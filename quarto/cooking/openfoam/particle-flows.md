# Particle Flows

## Foreword

This document discusses elements of Lagrangian particle flow modeling in OpenFOAM; currently it does not cover field-based Lagrangian clouds as the related documentation and set of examples is not yet considered mature enough. Nonetheless, it will revisit this topic in the future as it seems a more natural approach for handling OpenFOAM cases. One can find it described [here](https://doc.cfd.direct/openfoam/lagrangian/) .
