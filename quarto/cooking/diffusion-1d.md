## Symbols

```python
# Discretization related
τ, δ = symbols("tau delta")

# Cell-based concentrations (c_0 = c_P^0)
c_E, c_P, c_W = symbols("c_E c_P c_W")
c_G, c_B, c_0 = symbols("c_G c_B c_0")

# Cell-based diffusivities
D_E, D_P, D_W, D_G = symbols("D_E D_P D_W D_G")

# Face-based diffusivities
D_e, D_w, D_g, D_b = symbols("D_e D_w D_g D_b")

# Face-based Fourier/Sherwood numbers
Fo_e, Fo_w, Fo_g, Sh_g = symbols("α_e α_w α_g, Sh_g")

# For boundary conditions
h, c_inf = symbols("h c_inf")

# Parameter aliases
β = symbols("beta")
```

Because it will be later useful for coefficient grouping, the following mapping is provided:

```python
Fo_g_expr = D_g * τ / δ**2
Sh_g_expr = h * δ / D_g

map_fourier = [
    (Fo_e_expr, Fo_e),
    (Fo_w_expr, Fo_w),
    (Fo_g_expr, Fo_g),
]

map_sherwood = [
    (Sh_g_expr, Sh_g),
]

display(map_fourier)
display(map_sherwood)
```




 As the boundary composition $c_{B}$ being prescribed, we can propose a linear interpolation such as

$$
c_{B} = \dfrac{c_{P}+c_{G}}{2} \implies c_{G} = 2c_{B} - c_{P}
$$

```python
expr_B = Eq(c_B, (c_P + c_G) / 2)
expr_B
```

Applying $c_{G}$ in place of $c_{W}$, this leads to:

$$
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)
\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
D_{e}\dfrac{c_{E}-c_{P}}{\delta}-
D_{g}\dfrac{c_{P}-2c_{B}+c_{P}}{\delta}
$$

```python
subs_rhs = [
    # Isolate c_G from expr_B (replace in c_W):
    (c_W, solve(expr_B, c_G)[0]),

    # Use compatible coefficient:
    (D_w, D_g),
]

eq = get_problem_eq_zero(subs_rhs=subs_rhs)
eq = eq.subs(map_fourier)
eq
```

To keep it simple, let's assume $c_{B}$ is constant (time-dependency would slightly complicate the development and it is worth postponing it to the algorithm development discussion), so keeping our fully implicit scheme leads to

$$
\left(1 + \alpha_{e}^{\tau} + 2\alpha_{g}^{\tau}\right)c_{P}^{\tau}-\alpha_{e}c_{E}^{\tau}=
c_{P}^{0}+2\alpha_{g}c_{B}
$$

or in coefficient mode

$$
A_{B}c_{P}^{\tau}+A_{E}c_{E}^{\tau}=c_{P}^{0}+B
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{E} &= -\alpha_{e}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
A_{B} &= 1 + \alpha_{e}^{\tau} + 2\alpha_{g}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
B &= 2\alpha_{g}c_{B}
\end{align*}
$$

There are two main features in this equation: the coefficient $A_{B}$ of cell $P$ now depends on the prescribed composition through the analytically determined $\alpha_{g}$ and a modification is applied to the right-hand side at boundaries where solution is prescribed. That's a good reminder that the array of coefficients must correspond to the number of interfaces, not cells.

```python
# XXX: notice that signs here corresponde to LHS!
tabulate_coefs(eq, variables=[c_P, c_E, c_B, c_0])
```

#### Type 2 - Neumann


Next, let's handle Neumann boundary condition (type 2). For a fixed flux boundary condition, the flux at the boundary is prescribed at $q_{B}$. A special case arises when one imposes zero flux (impermeable boundary for mass transfer, adiabatic boundary for heat transfer) where $q_{B}=0$. It is worthless formulating the problem for this case as the equation is trivial, so we will assume a general $q_{B}$ in what follows.

$$
-D\dfrac{\partial{}c}{\partial{}x}\bigg|_{B} = q_{B}
$$

When dealing with Neumann boundary conditions one must take care of the sign of fluxes, especially in 1-D. In higher dimensions, when applying Gauss theorem to convert the volume integral into a surface integral one normally works with vector calculus formulations; here we have dropped the vector notation when integrating over $dx$, but the concept of surface orientation must be recalled at this point. At the _west_ boundary the flux into domain is positive and conversely, at the _east_ boundary the flux out of domain is positive.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
D_{e}\dfrac{c_{E}-c_{P}}{\delta} + q_{B}
\\[12pt]
\text{(east)}\qquad &
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
-q_{B} - D_{w}\dfrac{c_{P}-c_{W}}{\delta}
\end{align*}
$$

#### Type 3 - Robin


Investigated approaches:

- [x] Direct _ghost_ cell flux calculation
- [ ] Employing immersed node at boundary


Finally, we generalize the above discussion for a Robin boundary condition (type 3). Also known as a convective or mixed boundary condition. In this case the flux is proportional to the concentration difference between the boundary and a reference external composition $c_{\infty}$. This often models mass transfer between a reacting fluid and a solid, but the discussion of boundary layer formation is out of the present scope and we summarize it simply by mass transfer coefficient $h$.

$$-D\dfrac{\partial c}{\partial x}\bigg|_{B} = h(c_{B} - c_{\infty})$$


This formulation is convenient computationally as one can approach a type 1 condition by enforcing $h\gg{}D$ (the analysis is trivial from the above differential); type 2 condition is not relevant to most solid state diffusion processes (because in general it is not simple to enforce a mass uptake by a material), so this type 3 condition is _all we need_ for a first solid state diffusion solver. As for the type 2 condition, we need to take care of signs here:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
D_{e}\dfrac{c_{E}-c_{P}}{\delta} + h(c_{B} - c_{\infty})
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
-h(c_{B} - c_{\infty}) - D_{w}\dfrac{c_{P}-c_{W}}{\delta}
\end{align*}
$$

```python
# Convective fluxes by definition:
B_w = +1 * h * (c_B - c_inf)
B_e = -1 * h * (c_B - c_inf)
```

By definition, FVM will evaluate the mean composition in a cell, so in fact we might think that $c_{B}=c_{P}$ might be a good replacement in the above expression. Nonetheless, this is not what we did when deriving type 1 boundary condition. In fact, the boundary composition has to be interpreted as not belonging to the cell itself. Another idea is to _recycle_ what we have done when deriving the type 1 boundary condition and add a _ghost_ cell beyond the boundary, which takes again a composition $c_{B}={\scriptstyle\frac{1}{2}}(c_{G}+c_{P})$.

**Identifying ghost node composition**

</div>


By replacing both $c_{W}$ and $c_{E}$ by $c_{G}$ where applicable, and taking care of sign manipulation (for the aestetics of getting similar equations), we can write

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
-D_{g}\dfrac{c_{P}-c_{G}}{\delta}=h\left(c_{B} - c_{\infty}\right)
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
-D_{g}\dfrac{c_{G}-c_{P}}{\delta}=h\left(c_{B} - c_{\infty}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

```python
# Fluxes computed w.r.t. ghost cell:
J_w = -1 * D_g * (c_P - c_G) / δ
J_e = -1 * D_g * (c_G - c_P) / δ
```

It is worth introducing here $\mathcal{Sh}$, the [Sherwood number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_number) (at least some sort of, as the length $\delta$ does not correspond to the actual length that should be used as per its definition); $\beta$ is just a placeholder variable introduced here to simplify the later equations as we shall see. It is given by

$$
\mathcal{Sh}=\dfrac{h\delta}{D_{g}}=2\beta
$$


In both cases we can rearrange equations to be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
c_{G}-c_{P}=\mathcal{Sh}\left(c_{B} - c_{\infty}\right)
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
c_{P}-c_{G}=\mathcal{Sh}\left(c_{B} - c_{\infty}\right)
\end{align*}
$$


We can now substitute $c_{B}$ to get:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
c_{G} = \dfrac{2\beta{}c_{\infty} - (\beta + 1)c_{P}}{(\beta - 1)}
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
c_{G} = \dfrac{2\beta{}c_{\infty} - (\beta - 1)c_{P}}{(\beta + 1)}
\end{align*}
$$

**Extended system formulation**

In the above formulation we solved for $c_G$, but in fact that may not be desirable. Solving for this variable means we should add a non-linear solution for each boundary condition before each system iteration. Since we are dealing with an already iterative problem (because coefficients are non-constant), it is worth adding the solution of $c_G$ in the same matrix as the main problem, strongly simplifying the code. This may slow down the first iterations until a first value of $c_G$ is found, but should not be a problem later (at least in 1-D).

</div>

```python
# TODO: check the signs! As if all at LHS!
eq_w = manipulate_robin(+J_w - B_w, solve_ghost=False)
eq_e = manipulate_robin(-J_e - B_e, solve_ghost=False)

display(eq_w)
display(eq_e)
```

```python
tabulate_coefs(eq_w, [c_G, c_P, c_inf])
```

```python
tabulate_coefs(eq_e, [c_G, c_P, c_inf])
```

The above equation tells us something interesting: we can use an extended system including a _ghost_ node to replace the convective equation by an equivalent diffusive flux term. That could already be expected from the original statement of type 3 boundary condition. The problem with this approach is that $c_{G}$ non-linearly depends on itself through the Sherwood number, and an additional equation needs to be solved to find its value (and the associated diffusivity) ahead of each solution iteration.

Now we are faced with a design choice: (1) we could introduce the previous equations for $c_{G}$ in boundary equations and workout the coefficients or (2) inser directly the corresponding value into the equation. The later approach leads to significantly simpler equations and is preferred here. After replacing $c_{B}$ in the boundary equation manipulate the expression to get

**TODO: fix these, incompatible with the above tables**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
(\beta - 1)c_{G} + (\beta + 1)c_{P} = 2\beta{}c_{\infty}
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
(\beta + 1)c_{G} + (\beta - 1)c_{P}= 2\beta{}c_{\infty}
\end{align*}
$$

and the first internal equation (second row of the matrix) gets the trivial form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
%
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
D_{e}\dfrac{c_{E}-c_{P}}{\delta} -
D_{g}\dfrac{c_{P}-c_{G}}{\delta}
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
%
\left(c_{P}^{\tau}-c_{P}^{0}\right)\dfrac{\delta}{\tau}=
D_{g}\dfrac{c_{e}-c_{P}}{\delta} -
D_{w}\dfrac{c_{P}-c_{W}}{\delta}
\end{align*}
$$

```python
subs_w = [(c_W, c_G), (D_w, D_g)]
subs_e = [(c_E, c_G), (D_e, D_g)]

eq_w = get_problem_eq_zero(subs_rhs=subs_w).subs(map_fourier)
eq_e = get_problem_eq_zero(subs_rhs=subs_e).subs(map_fourier)

display(eq_w)
display(eq_e)
```

```python
tabulate_coefs(eq_w, variables=[c_P, c_E, c_W, c_0])
```

```python
tabulate_coefs(eq_e, variables=[c_P, c_W, c_E, c_0])
```

Reorganizing to get the linear formulation:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
%
-\alpha_{g}^{\tau}c_{G}^{\tau}+
(1+\alpha_{e}^{\tau}+\alpha_{g}^{\tau})c_{P}^{\tau}
-\alpha_{e}^{\tau}c_{E}^{\tau}=c_{P}^{0}
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
%
-\alpha_{w}^{\tau}c_{W}^{\tau}+
(1 + \alpha_{g}^{\tau}+\alpha_{w}^{\tau})c_{P}^{\tau}
-\alpha_{g}^{\tau}c_{G}^{\tau}=c_{P}^{0}
\end{align*}
$$


or in final coefficient mode as before

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{(west)}\qquad &
%
A_{G}c_{G}^{\tau}+A_{(0)}c_{P}^{\tau}+A_{E}c_{E}^{\tau}=c_{P}^{0}
%
\\[12pt]
%
\text{(east)}\qquad &
%
A_{W}c_{W}^{\tau}+A_{(n)}c_{P}^{\tau}+A_{G}c_{G}^{\tau}=c_{P}^{0}
\end{align*}
$$


In the above equation one may notice a preliminary introduction of cell numbering, we will come in detail to this point in the next section. For now simply notice that the following provides the coefficients mapping, where care has been taken to differentiate at what location _ghost_ cell values are evaluated when not self-evident.

$$
\begin{align*}
A_{(0)} &= 1 + \alpha_{e}^{\tau}+\alpha_{g}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
A_{(n)} &= 1 + \alpha_{g}^{\tau}+\alpha_{w}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
A_{G} &= -\alpha_{g}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
A_{W} &= -\alpha_{w}^{\tau}
\\[6pt]
A_{E} &= -\alpha_{e}^{\tau}
\end{align*}
$$

With this we have gone through the full derivation of 1-D diffusion in solids. This enables the more convenient formulation of the problem as an iterative linear solution for time advancement.
