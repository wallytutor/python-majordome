# SSH key generation

**Creating the keys:** generate the SSH key pair locally (*i.e.* on your workstation); common options are:

- `-t rsa`: key type (RSA is widely supported)
- `-b 4096`: key length (more bits = stronger, recommended 4096)
- `-C` : comment (usually your email)

When running the command, accept defaults for storage at `~/.ssh/id_rsa[.pub]`; optionally add a passphrase for additional security (but then you will need to enter it each time you need to connect, so that's undesirable if the only reason you are creating the SSH key is to have quick access to the server).

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yourusername@your.server.com"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096 -C "yourusername@your.server.com"
```

If you have password access to the server and `ssh-copy-id` run the following:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote_host
```

Alternatively (in Windows PowerShell for instance but reformat it in a single line or replace the pipes by backticks) manually append to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | \
    ssh yourusername@your.server.com \
    "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

As a last option do it by hand, but you risk breaking the format of `authorized_keys`.

**Testing Linux server:** before anything, try connecting with you identity:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa yourusername@your.server.com
```

If that falls-back to your password connection, connect normally to the server and make sure the rights of both SSH directory and authorized keys file are right before trying again:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Maybe the server SSH has not been enabled for key authentication, which can be inspected without opening the actual configuration file through (requires `sudo` rights):

```bash
sudo sshd -T | grep pubkeyauthentication
```

If it is not enabled, you can edit the file (find and modify `PubkeyAuthentication yes`) as follows and restart the service:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Additional step for SELinux only:
restorecon -Rv ~/.ssh
```

Test again; upon new failure, try the verbose mode of SSH connection on your workstation:

```bash
ssh -v yourusername@your.server.com
```

while simultaneously connected to the server (`sudo`) reading the logs:

```bash
# Debian-based:
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

# Under RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
sudo tail -f /var/log/secure
```

**Adding the key to VS Code** by perform the following steps:

- Install `Remote-SSH` extension
- Press `F1` and search for `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File`
- Add an entry like the following (modifying the host name and user):

```
Host myserver
    HostName your.server.com
    User yourusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If the above fails to fill in your right user name (sometimes Windows username will appear) you can try the following workaround to enforce user:

```bash
Host yourusername@your.server.com
    HostName your.server.com
    User yourusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**About cluster usage:** that is the single case you might want to store both public and private keys at the same `.ssh`; to navigate across nodes (assuming your `$HOME` directory is the same) you need both keys. Please keep in mind to use a different key pair than the one you use to connect to the cluster for security reasons.
