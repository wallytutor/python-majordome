# Selection of tools

## Geometry

- [blender](https://www.blender.org/): the most powerful 3D (in the general sense) open source modeling tool; allows geometries to be exported to STL, which is compatible with most meshing software.

- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/?lang=fr_FR): contrarily to [blender](https://www.blender.org/), this is the most mature open source modeling tool in the technical sense. It supports both 3D conception and detailed drawing, among other features.

- [cadquery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery?tab=readme-ov-file): a simple parametric geometry tool.

## Meshing

-  [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/): the *to-go* meshing tool for 2D geometries and visualization of many formats of 3D meshes; before trying to produce reliable structured meshes and geometry in 3D some ninja skills need to be developed. Its own scripting language makes parametric meshing easy.

- [MeshLab](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab): allows to manipulate triangulated grids generated in CAD; helpful for preparing patches for use with #OpenFOAM/snappyHexMesh.

## Rendering

- [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/): the *de facto* post-processing tool for many fields of application.

- [trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/): rendering results in web-applications.

## Simulation

- [Elmer](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/elmer/): multiphysics FEM toolkit (see dedicated topic).

- [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/): general purpose FVM CFD toolkit (see dedicated topic).

- [TRUST Platform](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/):  the basis for [TrioCFD](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code) code by CEA.

## Productivity

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is the *de facto* solution for note-taking and *second brain* management, but it is not free for commercial ends and that has become a problem for my intended work use. Looking for alternatives for this tool which is my main productivity setting, I came across the following packages. Testing was done with *I want it to be the same* mindset and if after a few minutes I was not convinced by the application, it was automatically discarded. In summary, I liked both *Joplin* and *Zettlr* but will pursue the use of the latter only as *Joplin* does not meet by criteria. *StandardNotes* is a false open-source package and *logseq* is still too raw for any production setting.

| [laurent22/joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/)  | Rich interface with many features; excellent tool if you are not seeking version control as a target. Available as portable executable. | Counterintuitive interface and files are not directly stored as `.md`; file system synchronization requires and absolute path. After closing the executable, a process was kept alive.                                               |
| [logseq/logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)         | Available as portable executable.                                                                                                       | Poor UI at first sight. Fast but *dumb* in the sense it will only support *one file* with a given title, what is incompatible with my way of organizing directories. Pages are not organized as in the folder view.                  |
| [standardnotes/app](https://github.com/standardnotes/app) | Interface is cleaner/less cluttered than Joplin. Available as portable executable.                                                      | Stopped using it as received the first notification that smart tags require a paid plan. Also only plain text files are supported in free mode.                                                                                      |
| [Zettlr/Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr)         | Support to YAML frontmatter. UI gets better as you open files. Integration to BibTeX.                                                   | Poor UI at first sight.  Not available as portable executable; but installation can be done in any user folder, what is also fine. It took a long time to import my existing *second brain* and sometimes it glitches/has some lags. |
