# Modeling of TTT diagrams of stainless steels

This works is based on data from `Wang, Hao (2019), "Data for: Study on time-temperature-transformation diagrams of stainless steel using machine-learning approach", Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/k7zspbmyvf.1` and associated data can be found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/k7zspbmyvf/1). Reference paper is found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109282).

## Objectives

- [ ] Check if `Ac1` can be used as an additional predictor for PE curves.
- [ ] Check if is possible to use `T` as a predictor for U-shaped models (transposed).
