Welcome to Majordome's documentation!
=====================================

**Majordome** (latin *major domus*) is a Python library with a bunch of boilerplate
code for use in scientifc applications. It was born from a personal perspective that
code should be reusable and maintainable. For more about the context where it was
born, please check my `Wally Tutor <https://wallytutor.github.io/>`_ page. Check out
the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
