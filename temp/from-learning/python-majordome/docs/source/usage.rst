Installation
------------

To use Majordome, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install majordome


This will provide you with the basic Python functionalities of the package.
Please notice that Majordome is used in several ways to manage other scientifc
libraries and use of some modules is restrained to the presence of those
external packages (most of which are not Python dependencies and must be
compiled for your specific platform). That said, Majordome is Linux-centric
as any serious scientifc package should be.
