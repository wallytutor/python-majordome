This is true of both sequential and parallel programs. In most cases that arise in an academic environment, it therefore makes sense to develop in ordinary Python, identify computational bottlenecks, and use Numba to remove them.},

Maybe you have never heard about this function, but it can be really useful working with continuous spaces in reinforcement learning. The numpy.digitize(x, bins, right=False) function has two arguments: (1) an input array x, and (2) an array of bins, returning the indices of the bins to which each value in input array belongs.
3. numpy.repeat
4. numpy.random
5. numpy.polyfit
6. numpy.polyval
7. numpy.nan
8. numpy.argmax
9. numpy.squeeze
The numpy.squeeze(a, axis=None) removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. The argument axis specifies the axis we want to squeeze out. If the shape of the selected axis is greater than 1 a ValueError is raised. An example of how to use numpy.squeeze function is shown below.

	abstract = {Abstract For many applications it is useful to sample from a finite set of objects in accordance with some particular distribution. One approach is to run an ergodic (i.e., irreducible aperiodic) Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution on this set; after the Markov chain has run for M steps, with M sufficiently large, the distribution governing the state of the chain approximates the desired distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to determine how large M needs to be. We describe a simple variant of this method that determines on its own when to stop and that outputs samples in exact accordance with the desired distribution. The method uses couplings which have also played a role in other sampling schemes; however, rather than running the coupled chains from the present into the future, one runs from a distant point in the past up until the present, where the distance into the past that one needs to go is determined during the running of the algorithm itself. If the state space has a partial order that is preserved under the moves of the Markov chain, then the coupling is often particularly efficient. Using our approach, one can sample from the Gibbs distributions associated with various statistical mechanics models (including Ising, random-cluster, ice, and dimer) or choose uniformly at random from the elements of a finite distributive lattice. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and support vector machines.

Such requirements arise, for instance, when prior knowledge of the process being observed is available. Monotonicity can be imposed by the addition of suitable penalization terms to the error function. The objective function, however, depends nonlinearly on the first-order derivatives of the network mapping. We show that these derivatives can easily be obtained by an extension of the standard back-propagation algorithm procedure. This yields a computationally efficient algorithm with little overhead compared to back-propagation.},

Here, we approach this problem by modelling a neural network architecture after the human physical reasoning process, which has similarities to representation learning. This allows us to make progress towards the long-term goal of machine-assisted scientific discovery from experimental data without making prior assumptions about the system. We apply this method to toy examples and show that the network finds the physically relevant parameters, exploits conservation laws to make predictions, and can help to gain conceptual insights, e.g. Copernicus' conclusion that the solar system is heliocentric.},

	abstract = {The first six chapters of this volume present the author's 'predictive' or information theoretic' approach to statistical mechanics, in which the basic probability distributions over microstates are obtained as distributions of maximum entropy (Le., as distributions that are most non-committal with regard to missing information among all those satisfying the macroscopically given constraints). There is then no need to make additional assumptions of ergodicity or metric transitivity; the theory proceeds entirely by inference from macroscopic measurements and the underlying dynamical assumptions. Moreover, the method of maximizing the entropy is completely general and applies, in particular, to irreversible processes as well as to reversible ones. The next three chapters provide a broader framework - at once Bayesian and objective - for maximum entropy inference. The basic principles of inference, including the usual axioms of probability, are seen to rest on nothing more than requirements of consistency, above all, the requirement that in two problems where we have the same information we must assign the same probabilities. Thus, statistical mechanics is viewed as a branch of a general theory of inference, and the latter as an extension of the ordinary logic of consistency. Those who are familiar with the literature of statistics and statistical mechanics will recognize in both of these steps a genuine 'scientific revolution' - a complete reversal of earlier conceptions - and one of no small significance.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {We develop a new method which extends Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations, only snapshots of state and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

GEKKO specializes in dynamic optimization problems for mixed-integer, nonlinear, and differential algebraic equations (DAE) problems. By blending the approaches of typical algebraic modeling languages (AML) and optimal control packages, GEKKO greatly facilitates the development and application of tools such as nonlinear model predicative control (NMPC), real-time optimization (RTO), moving horizon estimation (MHE), and dynamic simulation. GEKKO is an object-oriented Python library that offers model construction, analysis tools, and visualization of simulation and optimization. In a single package, GEKKO provides model reduction, an object-oriented library for data reconciliation/model predictive control, and integrated problem construction/solution/visualization. This paper introduces the GEKKO Optimization Suite, presents GEKKO’s approach and unique place among AMLs and optimal control packages, and cites several examples of problems that are enabled by the GEKKO library.},

A ROS component is provided, and the controllers are tested with matching a pose using either transformation matrices or dual quaternions, trajectory tracking while remaining in a bounded workspace, maximizing manipulability during a tracking task, tracking an input marker’s position, and force compliance.},

	abstract = {Given a transformation between input and output values, described by a mathematical function f, optimization deals with generating and selecting a best solution from some set of available alternatives, by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set, computing the output of the function, and recording the best output values found during the process. Many real-world problems can be modeled in this way. For example, the inputs can be design parameters of a motor, the output can be the power consumption, or the inputs can be business choices and the output can be the obtained profit.
An optimization problem, in this case a minimization problem, can be represented in the following way

Given: a function f : A 
  
    
      
        →
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}to \}
   R from some set A to the real numbers
Search for: an element x0 in A such that f(x0) ≤ f(x) for all x in A.In continuous optimization, A is some subset of the Euclidean space Rn, often specified by a set of constraints, equalities or inequalities that the members of A have to satisfy. In combinatorial optimization, A is some subset of a discrete space, like binary strings, permutations, or sets of integers.
The use of optimization software requires that the function f is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compile or run time to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in A, the software module realizing f will deliver the computed value f(x) and, in some cases, additional information about the function like derivatives.
In this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function f, or a given optimization software can be used for different functions f.

	abstract = {The GEKKO Python package solves large-scale mixed-integer and differential algebraic equations with nonlinear programming solvers (IPOPT, APOPT, BPOPT, SNOPT, MINOS). Modes of operation include machine learning, data reconciliation, real-time optimization, dynamic simulation, and nonlinear model predictive control. In addition, the package solves Linear programming (LP), Quadratic programming (QP), Quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), Nonlinear programming (NLP), Mixed integer programming (MIP), and Mixed integer linear programming (MILP). GEKKO is available in Python and installed with pip from PyPI of the Python Software Foundation.

GEKKO works on all platforms and with Python 2.7 and 3+. By default, the problem is sent to a public server where the solution is computed and returned to Python. There are Windows, MacOS, Linux, and ARM (Raspberry Pi) processor options to solve without an Internet connection. GEKKO is an extension of the APMonitor Optimization Suite but has integrated the modeling and solution visualization directly within Python. A mathematical model is expressed in terms of variables and equations such as the Hock \& Schittkowski Benchmark Problem \#71 used to test the performance of nonlinear programming solvers. This particular optimization problem has an objective function

Robust Control, Part 2: Understanding Disk Margin - https://youtu.be/XazdN6eZF80
Robust Control, Part 3: Disk Margins for MIMO Systems - https://youtu.be/sac\_IYBjcq0

This videos covers a high-level introduction to robust control. The goal is to get you up to speed with some of the terminology and to give you a better understanding of what robust control is and how it fits into the larger control field.

A system is robust if it’s capable of meeting requirements (usually stability or performance measures) even in the presence of model or disturbance uncertainty. Basically, it’s being able to say, I don’t know my system perfectly or the environment it’s going to operate within, but I’m confident it’s going to work!

And robust control theory is how we get that confidence. It’s a method or an approach that we can use to design a system in a way that can handle uncertainty.

In this first video, we put some intuition behind these definitions.

This video walks through the phases of a typical project and describes what it means to be a control systems engineer. It covers the concept formulation phase, in which your job is to help form a broadly defined "need.” The video covers requirements and how a control engineer works with systems engineering to describe the system. We walk through the development phase, in which design, implementation, and evaluation take place and special emphasis is placed on modeling, test, and verification. Finally, the video covers some of a control systems engineer’s responsibilities after the product is in operation.

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep neural networks. These are terms that can spark your imagination of a future where robots are thinking and evolving creatures.

In this video, we provide an overview of reinforcement learning from the perspective of an engineer. Reinforcement learning is type of machine learning that has the potential to solve some really hard control problems. By the end of this series, you’ll be better prepared to answer questions like:

What is reinforcement learning and why should I consider it when solving my control problem?
How do I set up and solve the reinforcement learning problem?
What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of reinforcement learning compared to a traditional controls approach?

Chances are you’ve interacted with something that uses a form of this control law, even if you weren’t aware of it.  That’s why it is worth learning a bit more about what this control law is, and how it helps. 

PID is just one form of feedback controller. It is the simplest type of controller that still uses the past, present, and future error, and it’s these primary features that you need to satisfy most control problems. That is why PID is the most prevalent form of feedback control across a wide range of physical applications.
However, often when learning something new in control theory, it’s easy to get bogged down in the detailed mathematics of the problem. So, this video skips most of the math and instead focuses on building a solid foundation.

In the first example, you’re going to see how a Kalman filter can be used to estimate the state of a system (the internal temperature of a combustion chamber) from an indirect measurement (the external temperature of the combustion chamber). 

The second example demonstrates another common use of Kalman filters, in which you can optimally estimate the state of a system (e.g., the position of a car) by fusing measurements from multiple sources (e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU), an odometer, and a GPS receiver) in the presence of noisy measurements.},

Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to: Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve: Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries pick the perfect data structure for a particular job: Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory: Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems. Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science.
