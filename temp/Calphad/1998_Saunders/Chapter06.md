# Chapter 6 - Phase Stabilities

## 6.1. INTRODUCTION

The CALPHAD approach is based on the axiom that complete Gibbs energy versus
composition curves can be constructed for all the structures exhibited by the
elements right across the whole alloy system. This involves the extrapolation of Gx
curves of many phases into regions where they are either metastable or unstable
and, in particular, the relative Gibbs energy for various crystal structures of the
pure elements of the system must therefore be established. By convention these are
referred to as lattice stabilities and the Gibbs energy differences between all the
various potential crystal structures in which an element can exist need to be
characterised as a function of temperature, pressure and volume.

The basic question is how to perform extrapolations so as to obtain a consistent
set of values, taking into account various complications such as the potential
presence of mechanical instability. Additional complications arise for elements
which have a magnetic component in their Gibbs energy, as this gives rise to a
markedly non-linear contribution with temperature. This chapter will concern itself
with various aspects of these problems and also how to estimate the thermodynamic
properties of metastable solid solutions and compound phases, where similar
problems arise when it is impossible to obtain data by experimental methods.

6.2. THERMOCHEMICAL ESTIMATIONS

6.2.1 General procedure for allotropic elements

Allotropic elements, which exhibit different crystal forms within accessible temp-
eratures and pressures, allow the Gibbs energies to be measured for at least some of
the possible alternative structures. Such data, although of necessity restricted to
particular regimes of temperature and pressure, were therefore used as the platform
for all the initial efforts in this field. The elements Mn (Weiss and Tauer 1958), Ti
and Zr (Kaufman 1959a) and Fe (Kaufman et al. 1963) thus provided the basis for
obtaining the first lattice stabilities for phase-diagram calculations. However, in
order to make the CALPHAD approach universally applicable, a knowledge of the
relative stability of the most frequently occurring crystal structures is also required
for elements which do not manifest allotropy under normally accessible conditions
of temperature and pressure. Kaufman’s conviction that a reliable set of basic
lattice stabilities could be assembled was undoubtedly the key concept for the
whole CALPHAD approach.

As with all physical phenomena, an agreed reference state has to be established
for each element or component. In order to have a firm foundation, this has
generally been taken as the crystal structure in which that element exists at standard
temperature and pressure.

This ensures that thermochemical (TC) lattice stabilities are firmly anchored to
the available experimental evidence. Although the liquid phase might be con-
sidered a common denominator, this raises many problems because the structure of
liquids is difficult to define; it is certainly not as constant as popularly imagined. It
is therefore best to anchor the framework for lattice stabilities in the solid state.

Figure 6.1(a) shows the relative position of the experimentally determined Gibbs
energy curves for Ti, which includes segments that refer to the stable low-
temperature c.p.h. a-phase, the high temperature b.c.c. §-phase and the liquid
phase. Figure 6.1(b) shows curves where properties have been extrapolated to cover
regions where, although the phases are metastable, properties can be estimated by
extrapolation from alloys which stabilise one or other of the phases in binary
systems.

It is clearly desirable to see if the total curve can be de-convoluted into parts that
can be identified with a specific physical property so that trends can be established
for the many cases where data for metastable structures are not experimentally
accessible. In principle, the TC lattice stability of an element in a specified crystal
structure @ relative to the standard state a can be comprehensively expressed as
follows (Kaufman and Bernstein 1970):

Oak = HELE + Giathe S(Gas99,T) + Gia! fas 79,T)
+ GPA aw Far ApvT) + G28 f(Eas Ep) + GE? fVas Vp, P). (6.1)

Here HIZe is the enthalpy of transformation at 0K, (0,7, A, E) denote
functions for the components associated with Debye temperature (6), electronic
specific heat (7), lambda transitions such as magnetism () and contributions (E)
related to multiple electronic states, s1,s2..., while f(P, Va, Vg) refers to the
function which generates the pressure contribution.

It may of course be unnecessary to consider all these terms and the equation is
much simplified in the absence of magnetism and multiple electronic states. In the
case of Ti, it is possible to deduce values of the Debye temperature and the
electronic specific heat for each structure; the pressure term is also available and
lambda transitions do not seem to be present. Kaufman and Bernstein (1970)
therefore used Eq. (6.2), which yields the results shown in Fig. 6.1(c).

The right-hand side can be separated into five parts. The first part is the enthalpy at
0 K, the second represents the zero point energy, the third is the Debye energy
term, the fourth is an approximation for the C, — C, correction while the last part
arises from the difference in electronic specific heats.

6.2.2 General procedure for non-allotropic elements

With the exception of a few allotropic elements, the necessary input parameters to
Egs (6.1) or (6.2) are not available to establish the lattice stabilities of metastable
structures. Therefore an alternative solution has to be found in order to achieve the
desired goal. This has evolved into a standard format where the reference or ground
state Gibbs energy is expressed in the form of general polynomials which reproduce
assessed experimental C, data as closely as possible. An example of such a
standard formula is given below (Dinsdale 1991):

Gal] ~ HEP? = 0-4 OF + Pin (T) + Yoda”. (6.3)
z

The left-hand term is defined as the Gibbs energy relative to the standard element
reference (SER) state where HSE js the enthalpy of the element or substance in its
defined reference state at 298.15 K, a, b, c and d,, are coefficients and n represents a
set of integers, typically taking the values of 2, 3 and -1. From Eq. (6.3) further
thermodynamic properties of interest can be obtained.

S = -b-c-cln(T)— } onda T™™ (6.3a)
H=a-cP -}0(n-1)d,7" (6.3b)
Gp =-c- on(n-1)d,T™. (6.3c)

Other phases are then characterised relative to this ground state, using the best
approximation to Eq. (6.1) that is appropriate to the available data. For instance, if the
electronic specific heats are reasonably similar, there are no lambda transitions and
T >> Op, then the entropy difference between two phases can be expressed just as
a function of the difference in their Debye temperatures (Domb 1958):

+ 9,
Stsb0 * Oey. (6.4)
Combined with the 0 K enthalpy difference, the Gibbs energy of metastable phases
can then be obtained by adding terms of the form (A-BT) to the reference state
value or, more specifically:
Go78 = HP — TSB (6.5)

where H°~? and S*~? are taken as constant with respect to temperature. A linear
model as shown in Fig. 6.1(b) is therefore a reasonable approximation at tempera-
tures above 0p. If the Debye temperatures are close enough, then the linear model
will also give a reasonable description of the lattice stabilities below the Debye
temperature (Miodownik 1986) and can be used to estimate a value of HB, since
this will be equal to the enthalpy of transformation measured at high temperature.
Such linear expressions form the basis of many listed metastable lattice stability
values but, in the longer term, it is desirable to return to a mode of representation
for the unary elements which re-introduces as many physically definable parameters
as possible. This is currently being pursued (Chase et al. 1995) by using either the
Debye or Einstein equation where

3
conmn(2) eS
and x = hv/RT, or
On\" — ebslT
Cinstein = ar() er ae (6.7)
Empirical fitting coefficients can be added (a;(i = 1,2...)) so that the C, is given by
Cat = Crebye, Einstein + ya T. (6.8)

The excess term should allow the total Gibbs energy to be fitted to match that of
Eq. (6.3) while at the same time incorporating a return to the inclusion of (0) and
£(7) in the lattice stabilities. With the increased potential for calculating metastable
Debye temperatures and electronic specific heats from first principles (Haglund
et al. 1993), a further step forward would be to also replace Eq. (6.5) by some
function of Eq. (6.8).

Expressions for the liquid phase are complicated by the presence of a glass
transition temperature (T,). A simple linear model for the liquid should not,
therefore, be used close to and below T;, and the curve representing the properties
of the liquid phase in Fig. 6.1(b) has subsequently not been extended to 0 K.
Further algorithms can be added to the high temperature linear treatment to provide
for the effect of the liquid — glass transition if required (Agren et al. 1995).
However, regardless of what happens close to and below Ty, an extrapolated curve
based on the concept of a retained liquid phase at 0 K will certainly yield the
correct Gibbs energy at high temperatures. A similar situation occurs with relation
to a magnetic transition, where it is physically impossible to retain the high-
temperature paramagnetic configuration below the corresponding critical Curie (or
Neel) temperature. Nevertheless, the procedure that has been generally adopted is
to define a Gibbs energy curve for the paramagnetic state which covers the whole
range of temperatures, and then add a magnetic Gibbs energy to it.

In addition to the melting point of the @ phase and the a/( allotropic
transformation temperature in Fig. 6.1(b), there is a further intersection between the
Gibbs energy of a and liquid phases. This corresponds to the metastable melting
point of the a phase. A linear model will then dictate that the entropy of melting for
ais defined by the entropies of melting and transformation at the two other critical
points (Ardell 1963),

Sok = gaB 4 ghok, (6.9)

This is a reasonable assumption providing the metastable melting point is well
above both the @p of the solid and the T;, of the liquid. Eq. (6.9) has the following
corollary:

He-8 = 72 Se! _ TP geok, (6.10)

If the procedure adopted to determine the melting characteristics of the metastable
phase is reversed, this provides a possible route for establishing TC lattice
stabilities in cases where the metastable allotrope is not experimentally accessible.
Moreover this is so even where the Gibbs energy curve for the metastable crystal
structure does not intersect the Gibbs energy curve of the ground state structure
(Fig. 6.1(d)). At first sight this does not seem particularly useful, because there is
still a requirement for two unknown parameters T? and AS*~“, where @ is the
experimentally inaccessible allotrope. However, the next two sections show how
meaningful estimates can be obtained for these two parameters.

6.2.2.1 The van Laar technique for estimating melting points. TP can be obtained
by extrapolation from the liquidus of alloy systems which contain a phase of struc-
ture ® by a technique originally suggested by van Laar (1908) but not considered
seriously until resuscitated by Hume-Rothery and Raynor (1940). It is described
succinctly in the following extract from their paper:

“\... the b.c.c. structure of the beta phase (in copper alloys) may be regarded as derived
from a hypothetical b.c.c. form of copper, which in pure copper is less stable than the
Sc.c. structure, but which becomes more stable when sufficient solute is present to
raise the electron concentration. From this point of view, which was already discussed
by Rosenhain in 1926, the actual phase diagram may be regarded as arising in the
way shown in Fig. 6.2, where the broken lines represent the extrapolation of the beta
phase solidus and liquidus into the region where the phase is no longer stable.”’

It was therefore appropriate that the first attempt to produce lattice stabilities for
non-allotropic elements dealt with Cu, Ag and Zn (Kaufman 1959b). It is also
significant that, because of the unfamiliarity of the lattice stability concept, this
paper did not appear as a mainstream publication although the work on Ti and Zr
(Kaufman 1959a) was published virtually at the same time. It was also realised that
the reliability of metastable melting points derived by extrapolation were best

obtained by combining the results from a number of different systems. Figure 3.6
from Kaufman and Bernstein (1970) shows this philosophy in action for the case of
b.c.c. Re.

6.2.2.2 The estimation of metastable entropies of melting. Many of the lattice
stabilities listed in the first embryonic database (Kaufman 1967) were obtained by
combining the extrapolated values of melting points with an estimate for the
entropy of fusion (S/) based on Richard’s rule. This dates to the last century and
states that all metals should exhibit an entropy of fusion approximately equal to the
gas constant R. However, with the accumulation of new experimental data for a
wider range of elements, this was seen to be an over-simplification. Different crystal
structures appear to have characteristic entropies of fusion with b.c.c. structures
generally showed the lowest values of S/, with higher values for f.c.c., c.p.h. and
various structures of increasingly lower symmetry (Chalmers 1959, Gschneider
1961). An additional trend relates to the variation of S/ with melting point
(Miodownik 1972a, Sawamura 1972). This was initially taken to be linear but,
when more recent values for the higher melting-point elements were included, this

<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="figures/placeholder.png" alt></p>
<p><em>Figure 6.3. Convergence of metastable melting point of Re derived by extrapolation from a number of different systems (from Kaufman and Bernstein 1970, p. 66).</em></p>
</div>

temperature dependence was shown to be markedly non-linear (Fig. 6.4(a))
(Miodownik 1986, Saunders et al. 1988). There is nevertheless a linear relationship
between S/ and H/ with an intercept value, for H/ = 0, which is consistent with
the ‘structural entropy’ term as originally suggested by Miodownik (1972a). As
might be expected, there is a similar but smaller intercept value in the corres-
ponding plot that relates S and H for allotropic transformations.

In order to use such empirical correlations as a general method for estimating
lattice stabilities, it is necessary to establish whether properties of metastable
phases will follow a similar trend to their stable counterparts. In the case of many
transition metals (Miodownik 1972a) this certainly seems to be a useful working
assumption, However, it is apparent that S/ for the high-temperature b.c.c.
structures of the rare earths are anomalously low (Gschneider 1961, 1975) and
some of the actinides show a similar effect; S/ for 3-Pu is, for example, only
3.09 J mol~! K-! (Dinsdale 1991). It has been suggested that electrons in partially
occupied f-levels can contribute an extra entropy component to the b.c.c. phase in
rare earths and actinides (Kmetko and Hill 1976), while Tiwari (1978) suggested
that the cumulative entropy of all prior transformations is a more constant quantity

(a) Variation of the entropy of fusion with melting point for different crystal structures (from Saunders et al. 1988) and (b) schematic illustration of the possibility of a change in value and sign for the entropy of transformation if the metastable structure has a low melting point (from Miodownik 1992).</em></p>
</div>

than the individual component entropies of transformation. But this begs the
question of how to estimate the entropies associated with specific transformations.

On the whole it seems reasonable to use plots such as shown in Fig. 6.4(a) to
estimate values for S! of experimentally inaccessible phases, bearing in mind the
exceptional elements discussed in the previous paragraph. However, an alternative
procedure (Grimwall et al. 1987, Fernandez Guillermet and Hillert 1988, Femandez
Guillermet and Huang 1988) is to use the average S/ value deduced for each
crystal class from the available experimental data (Gschneider 1964).

The values of S*? deduced from both approaches will be similar for low-
melting-point elements, or when the melting points of the stable and metastable
elements are close together. However, they diverge significantly when there is an
appreciable difference between the melting points of the stable and metastable
structures. This is because using S/ vs temperature plots as shown in Fig. 6.4(b)
predicts that there would be a change in the magnitude and, potentially, of the sign
of S~? when differences in melting temperatures become large (Saunders ef al.
1988), while the use of an average S/ for the different classes of crystal structure
automatically defines that S*~? will be constant.

It is worth considering whether the trends shown in Fig. 6.4 have any theoretical
basis. Originally the intercept values were empirically rationalised in terms of
numbers of nearest neighbours (Miodownik 1972a). An electron structure approach
used by Friedel (1974) yields the right sign for S'°*—><<., but the predicted
magnitude is too high and applying this approach to the other crystal structures
does not yield meaningful results. Relating S/ to differences in 8p (see Eq. (6.4)) is
a more fruitful approach (Grimwall and Ebbsjo 1975, Grimwall 1977). A relation
between the intercept values of S/ in Fig. 6.4(a) and the Debye temperature can be
invoked using the structural dependence of the constant (C,) in the well-known
Lindemann equation

0p = CLV, 487)? MV? (6.11)

where V, is the atomic volume, T the melting point and M the atomic weight. A
dimensional analysis indicates that C2 has the same dimensions as entropy, and
Table 6.1 shows that S/ and C? are closely proportional (Achar and Miodownik
1974). This accounts for the empirical finding that a further set of constant values
for Cy, can be obtained if the allotropic transformation temperature is substituted
for the melting point in the Lindemann equation (Cho and Puerta 1976).
However, most of the examples quoted in these earlier papers do not include the
higher melting-point elements such as W, where a detailed treatment shows that the
total entropy (at least of the solid phases) must include many other components
such as the electronic specific heat, anharmonicity terms and the temperature
dependence of @p (Grimwall et al. 1987, Moroni et al. 1996). An estimate for the
Debye temperature of the high-temperature 3 phase was included in the seminal
paper on Ti and Zr (Kaufman 1959a), but the treatment did not take into account
the inherent mechanical instability of the high temperature phase. More recent
work has shown that, in the case of these elements, suitable anharmonic con-
tributions can stabilise the b.c.c. phase in Ti and Zr and that the vibrational entropy
contribution accounts for 70% of S°*~*? at the allotropic transformation temperature
(Ho and Harman 1990, Petry et al. 1991). As, in this case, the mechanical
instability is only marginal the treatment of Kaufman (1959a) may be considered a
good approximation. However, when there is a much more marked instability, as in
the case for tungsten (Fernandez Guillermet et al. 1995, Einarsdotter et al. 1997)
any vibrational entropies calculated from Debye temperatures may be totally
inappropriate.

6.2.2.3 Determination of transformation enthalpies in binary systems. 

Just as
consistent values of T,, for elements can be obtained by back-extrapolation from
binary systems, so it is possible to obtain values of H°~? by extrapolating the
enthalpy of mixing vs composition in an alloy system where the phase has a
reasonable range of existence. The archetypal use of this technique was the
derivation of the lattice stability of f.c.c. Cr from the measured thermodynamic
properties of the Ni-based f.c.c. solid solution (7) in the Ni-Cr system (Kaufman
1972). If it is assumed that the f.c.c. phase is a regular solution, the following
expression can be obtained:

ay,
RT In Se = Goer fee + Oh, (6.12)

where the left-hand side refers to the activity coefficient of Cr in the Ni solid solu-
tion, +, the right-hand side contains the ‘lattice stability’ value for f.c.c. Cr while 2
is the regular solution interaction parameter.

Plotting a2, /ac, vs z}, then leads to a straight line with an intercept equal to the
Gibbs energy difference between the f.c.c. and b.c.c. forms of Cr, at the tempera-
ture where measurements were made (Fig. 6.5), while the slope of the line yields the
associated regular solution interaction parameter. The lattice stability and the
interaction parameter are conjugate quantities and, therefore, if a different magnitude

</div>

for the lattice stability is adopted, the results can only be fitted by using a more
complex solution model (e.g. sub-regular). In the case of Ni-Cr, the use of a regular
solution model leads to a lattice stability for f.c.c. Cr which coincides closely with the
value obtained independently through liquidus extrapolations (Saunders et al. 1988).

However, on the basis of calculations of lattice stabilities from spectroscopic
data, Brewer (1967, 1979) has consistently maintained that interaction coefficients
can change drastically with composition, and that extrapolated lattice stabilities
obtained with simple models should therefore be considered as only ‘effective’
values. While this may indeed be true when mechanical instability occurs, many of
the assumptions which underlie Brewer’s methodology are questionable. A core
principle of the spectroscopic approach is the derivation of ‘promotion energies’
which require the definition of both ground and excited levels. Assumptions con-
cerning the relevant excited state have always been strongly coloured by adherence
to the empirical views of Engel (1964) and Brewer (1967). By definition, the choice
of atomic ground states ignores all band-structure effects, and calculations by
Moruzzi and Marcus (1988a) for the 3D transition elements highlight the omitted
factors. It is interesting to note that there have been progressive changes in
underlying assumptions over the years (Brewer 1975, Kouvetakis and Brewer
1993) and the lattice stabilities obtained by this route are now much closer to those
currently produced by the more conventional TC method.

6.2.2.4 Utilisation of Stacking-Fault Energies. Experimental values of stacking-
fault energies (SFE) offer a method of providing energy differences between stable
and metastable close-packed structures. A rigorous relationship involves modelling
the interface between the fault and the matrix, but a good working formula can be
established by assuming that this interfacial energy term is constant for a given
class of alloys (Miodownik 1978c).

phases in mJ m7?, o is the energy of the dislocation interface, p is the density in
gcm~, M the molecular weight in grammes and Gi<¢~¢P-». the Gibbs energy in
J mol~!. Eqs (6.13) and (6.14) were originally used to predict the SFE of a wide
range of stainless steels, but they have also been used, in reverse, to estimate values
of Gfee—cPh. of some f.c.c. elements (Saunders et al. 1988) where they provide
values which are in excellent agreement (Miodownik 1992) with those obtained by
FP methods (Crampin et al. 1990, Xu et al. 1991).

Although this method is essentially restricted to a particular sub-set of lattice
stabilities, it nevertheless provides an additional experimental input, especially in
cases where it is not possible to access the metastable phase by other methods. It is
therefore disappointing that there are no experimental values of the SFE available
for Ru or Os, which could provide confirmation of G°P+—f<«. obtained by other
methods. High SFE values have, however, been both observed and predicted for Rh
and Ir, which is indirect confirmation for a larger variation of Gicomeph. with
d-shell filling than proposed by Kaufman and Bernstein (1970).

6.2.3 Summary of the current status of thermochemical estimates

While all extrapolative methods have some disadvantages, there is no doubt that
remarkably consistent values have been obtained through combining extrapolations
from various different TC methods. This has led to the consolidation of lattice
stabilities of a large number of elements (Dinsdale 1991). The driving force for such

a compilation is that, if lattice stabilities are allowed to become floating parameters,
characterisations of different sub-systems will become incompatible when joined in
a multi-component database, even though the individual characterisations are
internally self-consistent. This leads to inconsistencies when such data bases are
subsequently combined and invalidates subsequent calculations.

Individual lattice stabilities have nonetheless to be continuously scrutinised as
there are many good scientific reasons to consider revisions at periodic intervals;
some of these are discussed below:

(1) Although changes in stable melting temperature are now quite rare, and
generally rather small, this is not the case for values of S!, where relatively large
changes have been reported in the last decade for a number of high-melting-
point elements. This can cause large changes in values of lattice stabilities
estimated from S/ in conjunction with extrapolated metastable melting points
and using Eq. (6.10) (Miodownik 1986, Saunders et al. 1988).
(2) Estimations of metastable melting points are invariably problematical. They
are inherently semi-quantitative in nature and depend on the extent of the
required extrapolation of stable liquidus lines which can be far away from the
element for which the extrapolation is being made.
(3) The use of linear models for many metastable allotropes, which incorporate
temperature independent enthalpy and entropies of transformation, has proved
adequate so far because calculations have tended to be made for elevated temp-
eratures, where the effect of incorporating more complex models seems marginal.
However, as requirements increase for handling non-equilibrium transformations
at lower temperatures, it is clearly necessary to have more accurate information
for extrapolated Gibbs energy curves. If this requires substantial revisions of
lattice stabilities to be made, there is clearly a premium on adding any further
effects (e.g., those arising from the liquid — glass transition) onto existing Gibbs
energy expressions so as to avoid changes in well-substantiated high-
temperature data (Agren et al. 1995). If high-temperature data were also to
change this would inevitably require major re-calculation of many systems.

(4) The increasing availability of electron energy calculations for lattice stabilities

has produced alternative values for enthalpy differences between allotropes at

0 K which do not rely on the various TC assumptions and extrapolations. Such

calculations can also provide values for other properties such as the Debye

temperature for metastable structures, and this in turn may allow the
development of more physically appropriate non-linear models to describe
low-temperature Gibbs energy curves.

6.3, AB INITIO ELECTRON ENERGY CALCULATIONS

Ideally, the 0 K values of the relative enthalpy for various crystal structures can be
obtained by ab initio (first-principles) electron energy calculations, using merely
atomic numbers and the desired atomic geometry as input. However, such methods
did not have sufficient accuracy at the time lattice stabilities were first brought into
use. An apocryphal analogy is that to obtain lattice stabilities by calculating the
difference in total energy of two crystal structures, is like determining the weight of
a ship’s captain by first weighing the ship empty and then weighing the ship with
the captain on the bridge!

Even as late as 1971 some methods were still unable to predict the correct ground
state for elements such as Zn, while the scatter obtained from various calculation
routes was far too high for ab initio phase stabilities to be introduced into a TC
database (Kaufman 1972). However, owing to a combination of improved model-
ling and the availability of more powerful computers, results have become increas-
ingly more consistent (Pettifor 1977, Skriver 1985, Watson et al. 1986, Paxton et
al. 1990, Asada and Terakura 1993). In many cases, the values obtained from first
principles (FP) have confirmed the values obtained by the thermochemical (TC)
methods outlined in the previous section. The convergence of FP and TC values for
the 0 K enthalpy is of great potential benefit to both the CALPHAD and physics
communities for the following reasons.

1. Despite the success of phase-diagram calculations, there is still a considerable
reluctance by sections of the scientific community to accept that TC lattice stabi-
lities represent a real physical entity as distinct from an operational convenience.
This inevitably creates doubts concerning the ultimate validity of the
calculations. It is therefore important to verify that TC lattice stabilities, largely
derived by extrapolation, can be verified by ab initio calculations and placed on
a sound physical basis.
2. From the physicist’s point of view, agreement with the CALPHAD figures for
metastable allotropes represents one of the few ways of assessing the validity of
their technique which is based on the principle that, once a theoretical model is
developed, there are no further adjustable input parameters other than the
atomic number and a fixed geometry for relative atomic positions. However, just
as a number of different extrapolative techniques have been used in the TC
approach, so a variety of assumptions have been used to solve the Schrédinger
equation for a complex ensemble of atoms, combining different levels of
accuracy with solutions that can be attained on a realistic time scale. A selection
is given in Table 6.2. As many methods were developed in parallel, the order in
which they are listed should not be considered important.

The most significant assumptions made in these various electron energy
calculations are indicated in the various acronyms listed in Table 6.2. These can be
permutated in many combinations and a proper comparison of these methods is
beyond the scope of the present article. Excellent review articles (Pettifor 1977,
Turchi and Sluiter 1993, de Fontaine 1996) are available if further detail is
required. Other references of particular interest are those which compare the results of making different combinations for specific groups of elements, see for example Moriarty and McMahan (1982), Fernando et al. (1990) and Asada and Terakura (1993).

6.3.1 Comparison between FP and TC lattice stabilities

Despite the variety of assumptions that have been used, some general trends for the
resultant lattice stabilities have been obtained for various crystal structures across
the periodic table. The mean values of such (FP) lattice stabilities can therefore be
compared with the equivalent values determined by thermochemical (TC) methods.
Such a comparison shows the following important features (Miodownik 1986,
Watson et al. 1986, Saunders et al. 1988, Miodownik 1992):

(1) In the main there is reasonable agreement for the sign and the magnitude of
the lattice stabilities for elements whose bonding is dominated by sp electrons
(Table 6.3) (see also Figs 6 and 7 of Saunders ef al. 1988). In the case of
elements such as Na, Ca and Sr, predictions have even included a reasonable
estimate of their transition temperatures. Good agreement is also obtained for
Group IVB elements such as Ge and Si (Table 6.4). The agreement for these
elements is particularly striking because the values obtained by TC methods
entailed large extrapolations, and for the case of Si(f.c.c.) a virtual, negative
melting point is implied. At first sight such a prediction could be considered
problematical. However, it can be interpreted in terms of the amorphous state
being more stable at low temperatures than the competing f.c.c. crystalline
configuration, and it does not contravene the third law as it is either metastable
or unstable compared to the stable A4 structure. In the case of W and Mo there is
now experimental evidence that supports this viewpoint (Chen and Liu 1997).

Table 6.3. Comparison of lattice stabilities (kJ mol!) obtained by TC and FP routes for elements whose bonding is dominated by sp electrons


(2) A sinusoidal variation of the 0 K energy difference between b.c.c. and close-
packed structures is predicted across the transition metal series, in agreement
with that obtained by TC methods (Saunders et al. 1988). For the most part mag-
nitudes are in reasonable agreement, but for some elements FP lattice stabilities
are as much as 3-10 times larger than those obtained by any TC methods (Fig. 6.6).
(3) FP methods inherently lead to a marked sinusoidal variation of H£e*-~¢?--
across the periodic table (Pettifor 1977) and for Group V and VI elements,
electron energy calculations predict H'**~*P*. of opposite sign to those
obtained by TC methods. It is worth noting, however, that a sinusoidal variation
is reproduced by one of the more recent TC estimates (Saunders et al. 1988)
although displaced on the energy axis (Fig. 6.7).

Some reconciliation can be achieved by considering the effect of changing

</div>

the c/a ratio (Fernando et al. 1990), as some of the hexagonal phases seem to
be most stable at c/a ratios which depart substantially from the ideal close-
packed value (~1.63). This factor is of significance in the case of elements like
Cd and Zn where c/a ~ 1.8 and it is clearly not appropriate to equate the Gibbs
energies of the ideal and non-ideal hexagonal forms (Singh and Papaconstanto-
poulus 1990). Making this kind of adjustment could reverse the sign of
Hfee~cph for Nb but does not really make much impact on the situation for
Mo, Ta and W. Likewise a change in volume within reasonable limits does not
resolve the issue (Fernando et al. 1990).

(4) In the past, electron energy calculations have failed dramatically for
magnetic elements since spin polarisation was not included. However, this can
now be taken into account quite extensively (Moruzzi and Marcus 1988b, 1990,
Asada and Terakura 1993) and calculations can reproduce the correct ground
states for the magnetic elements.

6.3.2 Reconciliation of the difference between FP and TC lattice stabilities for
some of the transition metals

Several approaches have been made in order to remove the outstanding conflicts
between FP and TC lattice stabilities. Niessen ef al. (1983) proposed a set of
compromise values, which are also listed in de Boer et al. (1988), but these do not
constitute a solution to this problem. These authors merely combined the two sets
of values in relation to an arbitrary reference state in order to refine their
predictions for heats of formation (see Section 6.6.1.1).

The accuracy with which a phase diagram can be fitted with competing values of
phase stabilities appeared, at one time, to be a fairly obvious route to discover
whether the TC or FP values were closer to reality. Tso et al. (1989) calculated the
Ni-Cr phase diagram using a series of different values for the lattice stability of
f.c.c. Cr. They were able to reasonably reproduce the phase diagram with energy
differences close to those proposed by electron energy calculations. However, they
could only do so by introducing a compensating change in the Gibbs energy of
mixing for the f.c.c. phase, which had to become large and negative in sign. It is
difficult to accept such a proposal for the enthalpy of mixing for f.c.c. alloys when
the liquid exhibits almost ideal behaviour and the b.c.c. phase has mainly positive
interactions. In addition, calculations of mixing energy by using d-band electron
models (Colinet et al. 1985, Pasturel et al. 1985) supports values much closer to
those already in use by CALPHAD practitioners.

A series of publications by various authors used a similar process to establish
which lattice stability gave the best fit for particular phase diagrams (Anderson ef
al. 1987, Fernandez Guillermet and Hillert 1988, Fernandez Guillermet and Huang
1988, Kaufman 1993, Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson 1985). Au-V formed a
particularly useful test vehicle (Fernandez Guillermet and Huang 1988, Kaufman

<div style="text-align:center">

<p><em>Figure 6.8. (a-d) The effect of varying the f.c.c.-b.c.c V lattice stability on the matching of and calculated phase boundaries in the Au-V system (after Fernandez Guillermet and Huang 1988) and (e) the effect of varying AS®**~"« on the minimum error sum, giving a preferred value of 7.5 kJ mol".
</em></p>
</div>

1993) as V was one of the elements which showed a serious discrepancy (Fig. 6.8). Using a regular solution model and restricting the range of S/, such an analysis (Fernandez Guillermet and Huang 1988) suggested that the optimum values of
Gbeetee were markedly lower than those obtained by electron energy calcu-
lations (Fernandez Guillermet and Huang 1988) and also significantly lower than
proposed by Saunders et al. (1988). The permitted range of lattice stability values
can be increased by changing these constraints, in particular letting S/ vary as
shown in Fig. 6.4(a), but any values still exclude FP predictions.

This impasse was eventually resolved by taking into consideration the calculated
elastic constants of metastable structures in addition to their energy difference at
0 K. Craievich et al. (1994), Craievich and Sanchez (1995) and Guillermet et al.
(1995), using independent calculations, have suggested that the difference between
TC and ab initio predictions may be associated with mechanical instabilities in the
metastable phase. This point had been raised earlier by Pettifor (1988) and has the
following consequence as reported by Saunders et al. (1988):

“‘.. the analogy with titanium and zirconium is useful. In these elements there is a
reported lattice softening in the b.c.c. allotrope near the c.p.h. — b.c.c. transforma-
tion temperature. This instability is reflected by a substantial C, difference between
the c.p.h. and b.c.c. structures which effectively destabilises the b.c.c. phase with
decreasing temperature. High-temperature extrapolations which ignore this, then
overestimate the low temperature stability of the b.c.c. phase. As ab initio calculations
give values for heats of transformation at 0 K, comparison with high-temperature
phase diagram and thermodynamic extrapolations will produce different results.””
Furthermore, such instabilities will extend into the alloy system up to a critical
composition and must therefore be taken into account by any effective solution-
phase modelling. In the case of Ni-Cr , it is predicted that mechanical instability, as
defined by a negative value of c! = 1/2(cj;—c12), will occur between 60 and 70
at%Cr (Craievich and Sanchez 1995), so beyond this composition the f.c.c. phase
cannot be considered as a competing phase.

While this concept of mechanical instability offers a potential explanation for the
large discrepancies between FP and TC lattice stabilities for some elements, the
calculations of Craeivich et al. (1994) showed that such instabilities also occur in
many other transition elements where, in fact, FP and TC values show relatively
little disagreement. The key issue is therefore a need to distinguish between
‘permissible’ and ‘non-permissible’ mechanical instability. Using the value of the
elastic constant C’ as a measure of mechanical instability, Craievich and Sanchez
(1995) have found that the difference between the calculated elastic constant C’ for
f.c.c, and b.c.c. structures of the transition elements is directly proportional to the
FP value of H><«—fe< (Fig. 6.9(a)).

The position of Ti and Zr is again important in this context. While the b.c.c.
phase in these elements has long been known to indicate mechanical instability at
0 K, detailed calculations for Ti (Petry 1991) and Zr (Ho and Harmon 1990) show
that it is stabilised at high temperatures by additional entropy contributions arising
from low values of the elastic constants (soft modes) in specific crystal directions.
This concept had already been raised in a qualitative way by Zener (1967), but the

<p><img src="figures/placeholder.png" alt></p>
<p><em>Figure 6.9. (a) Proportionality of calculated values of AH!*-b<* to the associated elastic instability as measured by the clastic constant C’ (Private Communication from Craievich and Sanchez 1995). (b) The difference between TC and FP lattice stabilities plotted vs the absolute value of the calculated FP lattice stability. When combined with Fig, 6.8 this suggests a critical value of the clastic instability that cannot be compensated for by thermal contributions.</em></p>
</div>

key issue is to find out whether there is a maximum value to the additional entropy
that is available to counterbalance specific values of mechanical instability at 0 K.
This would be consistent with the observation that major discrepancies between FP
and TC lattice stabilities only seem to arise when the mechanical instability rises
beyond a critical value (Fig. 6.9(b)). This is also consistent with the findings of
(Fernandez Guillermet et al. 1995), who could only reproduce the phase diagram
for W-Pt by invoking an empirical and highly anomalous value of Sf*<—b<«.
which would also have to exhibit a strong temperature dependence to avoid the
appearance of f.c.c. W as a stable phase below the melting point.

The effect of incorporating a more complex entropy function has also been
examined by Chang et al. (1995) using the Ni—Cr system as a test vehicle. Here an
anomalous entropy contribution was simulated by incorporating a dual Debye
temperature function, linked to the critical composition at which the elastic
constants had been calculated to change sign in this system. The resulting lattice
stability for the f.c.c. phase nicely shows how this approach rationalises the
extrapolated liquidus derived using the van Laar method and values that would be
consistent with a FP approach. Figure 6.10 shows that the phase diagram in the
stable region does not suffer inaccuracies by using high FP values as happened in
the earlier attempts on Au-V (Fig. 6.8). It should, however, be emphasised that the
equations used by Chang et al. (1995) to define the Gibbs energy of f.c.c. Cr are
highly empirical and require a whole new set of adjustable parameters, such as a
critical temperature which defines the onset of mechanical instability. This poses an

</div>

exciting challenge to provide a sounder basis for a treatment that can encompass
low-temperature mechanical instability. The present situation concerning FP and
TC lattice stabilities can probably be described as follows.

1. Thermochemical methods generate lattice stabilities based on high-

temperature equilibria that yield self-consistent multi-component phase-diagram

calculations. However, as they are largely obtained by extrapolation, this means
that in some cases they should only be treated as effective lattice stabilities.

Particular difficulties may occur in relation to the liquid — glass transition and

instances of mechanical instability.

2. By contrast, electron energy calculations have the inherent capability of

yielding accurate values for many metastable structures at 0 K but have little or

no capability of predicting the temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy,
especially in cases where mechanical instabilities are involved.

Although the two methodologies are complementary, attempts at producing Gibbs
energy curves which combine the two approaches are currently still empirical and
would, in practice, be very difficult to incorporate in a general CALPHAD
calculation. A more fundamental treatment of various entropy contributions is
required to achieve proper integration. Until this is realised in practice, the use of
TC lattice stability values as well established operational parameters, valid at high
temperatures and for most CALPHAD purposes, is likely to continue for the
foreseeable future.

6.4, THE BEHAVIOUR OF MAGNETIC ELEMENTS

The treatment outlined so far has not included the magnetic Gibbs energy
contributions in Eq. (6.1) because the ground state of the majority of elements is
paramagnetic. This, however, is certainly not the case for some key 3d transition
elements, which exhibit various forms of magnetic behaviour not only in the
ground state but also in one or more allotropes. Fe is a classic example and since
ferrous metallurgy has been a major driving force in the development of phase
diagram calculations, one of the first steps was to establish the magnitude of the
magnetic component on the Gibbs energy. The basic factors that control this are
detailed in Chapter 8, but it is worthwhile here to review some of the implications
for specific elements, with particular emphasis on Fe.

6.4.1 Fe

Considerable information is available on the magnetic parameters associated with
three different crystal structures of Fe which are b.c.c. and fic.c. at ambient
pressures and c.p.h. which is observed at high pressures. Table 6.5 gives the
corresponding values of the maximum enthalpy and entropy contributions due to
Table 6.5. Maximum values of the magnetic enthalpy and entropy for various allotropes of Fe, Co and
Ni based on data and methodology drawn from Miodownik (1977) and additional data from de Fontaine
et al. (1995), Structures in brackets correspond to metastable forms that have not been observed in the 7P
diagram of the element

magnetism, Hmeé and Sm respectively, and Fig. 6.11(a) shows how this affects
the total Gibbs energy for the three structures in Fe. At high temperatures Fe
behaves like many other allotropic elements, solidifying in a b.c.c. lattice, (6-Fe).
As the temperature is reduced, there is a transition to the f.c.c. -y-Fe phase which
has both a lower energy and a lower entropy. However because of G™* the b.c.c.
phase reappears at lower temperature as a-Fe. While the Curie temperature of a-Fe,
770°C, is actually 140°C below the a/- transformation temperature at 910°C, there
is already sufficient short-range magnetic order to cause the transformation. A con-
sequence of this unique behaviour is that the value of G>**—*««: remains exceed-
ingly small in the region between the two transition points and never exceeds 50-60
J mol“! (see Fig. 6.11(b)). This means that small changes in Gibbs energy, due to
alloying, will substantially alter the topography of the y-phase region in many Fe-
base systems. If the alloying element also significantly affects the Curie tempera-
ture, the proximity of the latter to the a/-y transus will mean that this boundary is
disproportionately altered in comparison to the 7/6 transus. This latter point can be
shown to account for the otherwise puzzling asymmetric effects of alloying
additions on the two transition points (Zener 1955, Miodownik 1977, Miodownik
1978b).

Because it is the basis of so many important commercial systems, the allotropy
of Fe has been re-examined at frequent intervals. There is relatively more experi-
mental information available for a-Fe, as this is the ground state, and relatively
little controversy about characterising this phase. There is also little difference
between the various proposals for G>**—<«: in the temperature range where y-Fe
is stable, because of the need to reproduce the two well-known transformation
temperatures T/7 and T7/* and their associated enthalpies of transformation (Fig.
6.11(b)). There are, however, different points of view regarding the extrapolation of
the Gibbs energy of the y-phase to low temperatures, which relate to different
weightings given to various specific heat measurements, assumptions made

regarding the magnetic description of y-Fe, and the significance placed on data
derived from low-temperature martensitic transformations (Fig. 6.12).

Johannson (1937) is generally credited with the earliest calculations of
G>ce-tee, which were based on the specific heat measurements of Austin (1932).

and Gustafson (1985), (m) Chang et al. (1985).

Relevant data extracted from activity measurements in the Fe-C phase were later
included in the assessment by Zener (1946) and Darken and Smith (1951). All this
work followed a traditional approach solely based on thermodynamic data derived
under equilibrium conditions. By contrast, Kaufman and Cohen (1958) showed that
the data of Johannson (1937) were more consistent with information derived from
Fe-based martensite transformations than the interpretation used by Darken and
Smith (1951). Together with the work of Svechnikov and Lesnik (1956) this was a
notable attempt to combine thermodynamic information derived from low-
temperature metastable transformations with those from more traditional sources.

Another such departure was the attempt by Weiss and Tauer (1956) to decon-
volute the global value of G><*—f<*<: into magnetic, vibrational and electronic
components. This represented the first attempt to obtain a physical explanation for
the overall effect. An even more comprehensive approach by Kaufiman et al. (1963)
led to the further inclusion of two competing magnetic states for y-Fe. Since the
computer programmes available at that time could not handle such a sophisticated
approach, the relevant values of G>¢*—f-<*. were converted into polynomial form
and subsequently used for the calculations of key Fe-base diagrams such as Fe-Ni,
Fe—-Co and Fe-Cr (Kaufman and Nesor 1973). .

Subsequent reassessments now took divergent routes. Agren (1979) used thermo-
dynamic data largely drawn from Orr and Chipman (1967) and re-characterised the
magnetic component of the a-phase with the Hillert and Jarl model (see Chapter 8).
The concept of two competing states in the -phase was abandoned as Orr and
Chipman (1967) favoured a high value for H>**~f<* and a suitable fit could be
obtained without invoking the added complications of this model. The Agren treat-
ment has been further refined in the most recent assessment of the 7~P properties of
Fe made by Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson (1985). By contrast, both
Miodownik (1978b) and Bendick and Pepperhoff (1982) pursued further evidence
for the existence of two gamma states from other physical properties and built
alternative assessments for Fe around this concept.

Although attention has tended to concentrate on the equilibrium between a- and
-Fe, the hexagonal variant, e, has also to be considered. This can only be accessed
experimentally in pure Fe when the b.c.c. phase is destabilised by pressure or
alloying additions. The extrapolated properties of e-Fe are consistent with it being
paramagnetic, or very weakly anti-ferromagnetic, and so magnetism will provide a
negligible contribution to its stability. Nevertheless, the extrapolation of SFE
versus composition plots confirms that the e-Fe becomes more stable than the y-Fe
at low temperatures, despite the magnetic contributions in the -y-phase (see Fig.
8.11 of Chapter 8). Hasegawa and Pettifor (1983) developed a model based on spin-
fluctuation theory which accounts for the T-P diagram of Fe without invoking any
differences in vibrational entropy or multiple magnetic states, but their theory
predicts that both close-packed states should exhibit a temperature-induced local
moment. The f.c.c. phase then behaves in a way which is rather similar to that
predicted by the phenomenological two-y-state model (Kaufman ef al. 1963). The
prediction of a high-temperature moment for the e-phase is, however, at variance
with the assumptions or predictions of most other workers who consider that the e-
phase has a zero or negligibly low moment. Various other models have been pro-
posed which break down the total Gibbs energy in different ways, for instance by
placing a different emphasis on the contribution of vibrational and electronic terms
(Grimwall 1974). Both the Pettifor-Hasegewa and the Grimwall models can account
for the some of the necessary qualitative features exhibited by the allotropy of Fe,
but the intrinsic assumptions of these two approaches are incompatible with each
other.

The various approaches were again reviewed by Kaufman (1991) who quoted
further evidence for the two-gamma-state concept, but virtually all current
databases incorporate the data generated by Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson
(1985) (Fig. 6.12). This has certainly been well validated in phase-diagram calcu-
lations, and it is hard to see how it could be improved at elevated temperatures.
However, the differences that appear at low temperatures may be important in
relation to metastable equilibria such as martensite transformations which, since the
early work of Kaufman and Cohen (1956, 1958), have tended to be excluded from
any optimisation procedure. Certainly there seems to be no doubt about the
existence of many competing combinations of crystal structure and magnetic
moments (Asada and Terakura 1993) (Fig. 6.13) which suggest that there must be
toom for an improved model.

1993).

6.4.2 Co

Table 6.5 shows that Co“? has a high value of H™&, so it is tempting to say that,
as with Fe, the low-temperature allotrope forms are due to strong stabilisation by
magnetic forces. However this is not the case, as Cof**: is also ferromagnetic with
very similar values of @ and T.. The magnetic contributions virtually cancel each
other out in this case, although the f.c.c/c.p.h. transformation temperature will
clearly be sensitive to small changes in magnetic parameters on alloying. The
magnetic properties of metastable b.c.c. Co were derived indirectly by Inden (1975)
as part of a calculation involving ordering in b.c.c. Fe-Co alloys. Interestingly,
these values are substantially confirmed by more recent FP calculations. Table 8.2
and Fig. 8.11 of Chapter 8 can be consulted for further details.

6.4.3 Ni

Ni does not exhibit any allotropy with respect to either temperature or pressure,
which implies that its f.c.c. structure must be significantly more stable than the
nearest competitors. This is consistent with values for Gf*°~¢?- derived from
SFE measurements and changes in SFE with alloying also suggest that there is a
magnetic component in G'**-"¢?-+.. Since the magnetic enthalpy is much smaller
than for Fe or Co, this in turn implies that that Nic. is paramagnetic or has a low
T, (Miodownik 1978a). However, FP calculations imply a value of @ not much
lower than for Nif**-, which would indicate that Ni behaves much like Co. Further
experimental information on the magnetic properties of Ni*?*-, possibly from thin
films, would clearly be desirable.

6.4.4 Mn

Experimentally Mn solidifies as the b.c.c. 6&-Mn phase, which then transforms to
f.c.c, y-Mn on cooling. This is entirely analogous to the behaviour of Fe. However,
it then undergoes two further low-temperature transitions to 6-Mn and a-Mn which
are complex crystal structures with large unit cells. De-convoluting the
experimental data into separate contributions is difficult. Three of the phases are
anti-ferromagnetic with widely differing values of the saturation magnetisation at
0K, and there are also significant differences in the Debye temperatures and
electronic specific heat. It is therefore difficult to make a consistent characterisation
which matches all these observations. By concentrating on matching phase transi-
tion temperatures and Debye temperature data, Fernandez Guillermet and Huang
(1990) were forced to use effective magnetisation values which could be as low as
¥, of those experimentally observed. This makes it impossible to estimate the real
tole of any magnetic factors in their treatment.

By contrast, in an earlier assessment, Weiss and Tauer (1958) decided to use the
measured magnetisation values as a primary input over the whole temperature
range, but then had to depart from the experimentally observed Debye tempera-
tures. Interestingly, their treatment led to the conclusion that the G curves for 6-Mn
and y-Mn would also intersect twice so that the behaviour of Fe could no longer be
considered unique. However in this scenario it is --Mn that has the largest magnetic
component, while the stability of G-Mn is dictated by a larger electronic specific
heat. The finding by Gazzara et al. (1964) that the value of the saturation mag-
netisation for a-Mn (and other anti ferromagnetic materials) can be temperature
dependent may have to be taken into account in order to finally reconcile what are
otherwise different interpretations of the same data. The relative Gibbs energy
curves for b.c.c., f.c.c. and c.p.h. Mn as calculated by Asada and Terakura (1993)
are shown in Fig. 6.13(b).

6.5. THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE

6.5.1 Basic addition of a PAV term

It is commonplace to assume a form of the Gibbs energy function which excludes
the pressure variable for solid-state phase transformations, as the magnitude of the
PAV term is small at atmospheric pressures. This is of course not the case in
geological systems, or if laboratory experiments are deliberately geared to high-
pressure environments. Klement and Jayaraman (1966) provide a good review of
the data available at the time when some of the earliest CALPHAD-type calculations
were made (Kaufman and Bernstein 1970, Kaufman 1974). Much work was also
carried out on specific alloy systems such as Fe-C (Hilliard 1963) and the TIl-In
system (Meyerhoff and Smith 1963).

The extra pressure term to be added to the Gibbs energy can be expressed as

P
Ga? = f ve~aP (6.15)

where V2~8 is the change in molar volume due to the transformation of a to 3.
Although this can be considered as constant to a first approximation, this will no
longer be true at high pressures, and several empirical descriptions have been
developed, depending on the pressure range in question. Bridgman (1931) used a
simple second-power polynomial to define the effect of pressures up to 3 GPa:

Vn =Vo+ViP+VyP? (6.16)

where Vo,2 are temperature dependent and have to be determined by experiment. If
the entropy, enthalpy and volume differences between these phases are assumed
independent of temperature and pressure is not excessive, then Eq. (6.15) will
obviously reduce to:

Go78 = pyanh (6.17)

where P and V2~* are given in GPa and m? respectively. This simple treatment
also leads to the familiar Clapeyron equation where the slope of the temperature vs

6.5.2 Making the volume a function of T and P

These earlier treatments have now been superseded by a more general approach,
where the molar volume of each phase as a function of temperature and pressure is
expressed as a function of the compressibility x (Fernandez Guillermet et al. 1985).

VIP <= Vo(1 + nPx)!” exp (cot thar 1?) (6.19)

where Vo is an empirically fitted parameter with the dimensions of volume and ap
and a are parameters obtained from fitting the experimental lattice parameter and
dilatometric data such that

aby =ao+a,T (6.20)

where a_, is the thermal expansivity at zero pressure as a function of temperature.
X is also expressed as a function of temperature using the polynomial

X= xo+.T + x27’. (6.21)

At constant temperature, Eq. (6.19) reduces to the simpler expression suggested
much earlier by Murnaghan (1944).

Available experimental data for various solid-liquid and solid-solid state trans-
formations has been successfully fitted for C, Mo and W (Fernandez Guillermet et
al. 1985) and Fe (Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson 1985) using the above
expression. It gives better results than Eq. (6.16) at high pressures and also has the
advantage that Eq. (6.19) can be inverted to give an expression for P™". This in
turn allows an explicit function to be written for the Helmholtz energy. Another
approach that has been considered recently is the Rose equation of state (Rosen and
Grimwall 1983). This however requires the additional input the expansion
coefficient and the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus. With the increasing
availability of such quantities from first-principles calculations, this may well
become the basis for future formulations (Burton et al. 1995).

Depending on the data available, Eqs (6.17){6.23) reproduce experimental
pressure effects with considerable accuracy in many cases. In particular, Eq. (6.18)
can be used to confirm entropy data derived using more conventional techniques
and can also provide data for metastable allotropes. Ti again provides a leading
example, as pressure experiments revealed that the w-phase, previously only
detected as a metastable product on quenching certain Ti alloys, could be stabilised
under pressure (Fig. 6.14). Extrapolation of the @/w transus line yields the
metastable allotropic transformation temperature at which the (-phase would
transform to w in the absence of the a-phase, while the slope of the transus lines can
be used to extract a value for the relevant entropy via Eq. (6.18).

6.5.3 Effect of competing states

All of the above approaches assume that missing pressure data can be estimated
from consistent periodic trends and that individual phases do not exhibit anomalous
behaviour. This is reasonable when the alternative crystal structures are each
associated with specific energy minima, but there can be some important exceptions

Figure 6.14. T-P diagram for Ti showing experimental data from Bundy (1965b)

and Jayaraman (1966) and the extrapolation of the G-w transus to yield the

metastable T® at atmospheric pressure (from Vanderpuye and Miodownik
1970).

to this general rule. For example, in magnetic systems it is possible to obtain
markedly different combinations of exchange and correlation forces in the same
crystal structure (Fig. 6.13) although the two structures can differ in energy by only
a small amount (Asada and Terakura 1993). The possibility of Schottky excitations
between alternative states can then produce an anomalous changes in volume with
temperature and pressure. Although it is always possible to handle such a situation
by a choice of suitable coefficients in Eq. (6.23), an alternative treatment is to
explicitly determine the effect on the Gibbs energy of having a combination of
states. This was attempted for 7-Fe using the following additional relationships
(Kaufman et al. 1963, Blackbur et al. 1965):

vnn = poy pays (6.24)

fe = aexp 40/RP (6.25)
TP

Ep” = Eplg” + PV™—™ (6.26)
GRp™ = 100PVP + RTIn(1- f*). (6.27)

Here V",V™ and f™, f refer to the molar volume and fractions of each state,
E~” js the difference in energy between the two states and G"~” jis the extra
increment of Gibbs energy resulting from the existence of the two states. Including
this term, the y/e temperature-pressure transus for pure iron was then quantitatively
predicted before this was verified experimentally by Bundy (1965a) (Fig. 6.15). The
fit is clearly not as good as that which can be obtained by Fernandez Guillermet and
Gustafson (1985) using Eqs (6.3) and (6.23), but on the other hand these authors
included the experimental pressure data in their optimisation and did not make any
specific provision for the possibility of multiple states. Which treatment is to be
preferred depends on whether priority is to be given to the development of simple
universally applicable algorithms or to more physically realistic models.

Data derived from pressure experiments on semi-conducting elements by Klement
and Jayamaran (1966) and Minomura (1974) have also been useful in obtaining
confirmation that the entropies associated with transitions in Si, Ge and Sn form a
consistent pattern, supporting the concept that each crystallographic transformation
tends to have a characteristic associated entropy change (Miodownik 1972a,
1972b). Similarly, extrapolations from pressure data on alloys can be used to obtain
estimates of lattice stabilities at P = 0, which can then be compared with estimates
obtained by other routes, such as SFE measurements.

Calculation of the critical pressure required to cause a phase transformation at
0 K can also be obtained from first-principle calculations. Assuming the various
phases exhibit normal elastic behaviour the tangency rule can be applied to energy
vs volume plots to yield values for the critical pressure that would generate a phase
transformation:

6G
Part = We (6.28)
However, if there are large variations in the elastic constants with pressure, this can

seriously affect P..j, by as much as an order of magnitude (Lam et al. 1984).

6.6. DETERMINATION OF INTERACTION COEFFICIENTS FOR ALLOYS AND STABILITY
OF COUNTER-PHASES

The determination of individual binary equilibrium diagrams usually only involves
the characterisation of a limited number of phases, and it is possible to obtain some
experimental thermodynamic data on each of these phases. However, when
handling multi-component systems or/and metastable conditions there is a need to
characterise the Gibbs energy of many phases, some of which may be metastable
over much of the composition space.

This requires a methodology for characterising a large range of metastable solu-
tions and compounds which, by definition are difficult, if not impossible, to access
experimentally. The available methods involve various levels of compromise
between simplicity and accuracy and can be categorised by the choice of atomic
properties used in the process.

At one end of the spectrum are first-principles methods where the only input
requirements are the atomic numbers Z,4, Za, ... the relevant mole fractions and a
specified crystal structure. This is a simple extension to the methods used to
determine the lattice stability of the elements themselves. Having specified the
atomic numbers, and some specific approximation for the interaction of the relevant
wave functions, there is no need for any further specification of attractive and
repulsive terms. Other properties, such as the equilibrium atomic volumes, elastic
moduli and charge transfer, result automatically from the global minimisation of
the energy for the total assembly of electrons and ions (Zunger 1980a, 1980b,
Pettifor 1992).

At the other end of the spectrum are more empirical methods which utilise
secondary properties which reflect more conventional terms, such as the atomic
volume, electronegativity or some function of the enthalpy of evaporation (Darken
and Gurry 1953, Hildebrand and Scott 1956, Mott 1968, Pauling 1960, Kaufman
and Bernstein 1970). In many cases the desire for simplicity has led to allocation of
a set of constant parameters to each atomic species, even though such properties are
known to vary substantially with the geometric or chemical environment in which
they are placed. This is probably adequate if such parameters are to be fed into a
correspondingly simple regular solution model or line compound model, but will
not be sufficient if there is a need for sub-regular solution parameters or if
substantial directional bonding is involved. Many treatments have been modified by
feedback to give better agreement with experimental trends. In some cases this has
been achieved by introducing additional terms and in others by merely altering the
numerical values that were originally tied rigidly to a measured property (Miedema
1976, Niessen et al. 1983).

6.6.1 The prediction of liquid and solid solution parameters

6.6.1.1 Empirical and semi-empirical approaches. The problem of making theoretical
estimates for the interaction coefficients for the liquid phase has been tackled in dif-
ferent ways by various authors. Kaufman and Bernstein (1970) considered that the
liquid state would exhibit the lowest repulsive forces of all the states of condensed
matter and that a description of the interaction parameters for the liquid state would
be the best basis for the prediction of interaction parameters for various solid phases.
Their expression for a liquid interaction parameter (L) follows Mott (1968) and
starts with the simple sum of an attractive term, e,, and a repulsive term, ep,

Lente. (6.29)

Kaufman and Bernstein (1970) derived e, via the electronegativity values, y; and
P2 (Pauling 1960)

> = —100 (p1 ~ yr)’. (6.30)

Estimates for ep were based on Hildebrand’s solubility parameters, 5,;, (Hildebrand
and Scott 1950), which are related to the enthalpy of vaporisation (H,jj)) and the
molar volume V,,i;) of elements i and j respectively so that

Making an adjustment for the effect of temperature finally leads to

Vinti) Vents)

Further parameters are then added to determine the interaction parameters for various
crystal structures, e.g., the interaction parameter, B, for b.c.c. structure becomes

B=Lt+eter (6.33)

Following Kaufman and Bernstein (1970) the first of these is a strain-energy term
depending on the volume difference between i and j which will always be a positive
contribution and assumed to be proportional to GV(AV/V)*, where G is a
modulus which, in the absence of data, can be approximated as Hyyjj/V. The
second term is based on the variation of H4~® with group number across the
periodic table reflecting the relation between e, and the heat of vaporisation.
Similarly, the interaction parameters E, for c.p.h. solutions, and A, for f.c.c.
solutions, become

E=Btes (6.34)

and
A=E+e. (6.35)

The strain energy term is thus assumed to be independent of crystal structure for the
three major types of substitutional solid solutions.

By contrast, the ‘macroscopic atom’ model of Miedema (Miedema et al. 1975)
starts with a descriptions of the solid state which is then modified to describe the
liquid state (Boom et al. 1976a, 1976b). In their model the enthalpy of formation at
0.5 mole fraction, H-=0.5 is given to a first approximation by:

Honas © [-P(A¢")* + Q(An,)? - RI. (6.36)

Here n,, is an electron density based on the volume of Wigner-Seitz atomic cells,
Vin, and it is assumed that differences in electron density An,, between different
species of atoms will always lead to local perturbations that give rise to a positive
energy contribution. On the other hand, ¢* is a chemical potential based on the
macroscopic work function ¢, so that differences, Ag", at the cell surfaces between
different species of atoms lead to an attractive term, analogous to the gain in energy
from the formation of an electric dipole layer. P, Q and R are empirically derived
proportionality constants. P and Q were initially taken to be adjustable parameters,
but turned out to be almost universal constants for a wide variety of atomic
combinations, especially amongst the transition metals. The parameter R was
introduced as an arbitrary way of adjusting for the presence of atoms with p
electrons and takes on values that increase regularly with the valency of the B-group
element. In contrast to the Kaufman model (Kaufman and Bernstein 1970), Eq.
(6.36) contains no parameters which refer to crystal structure and therefore the
heats of solution of f.c.c., b.c.c. and c.p.h. structures are predicted to be, a priori,
identical. The same conclusion can also be expected for liquid solutions, and indeed
the suggested parameters for liquid and solid solutions are very similar. The
constants P and Q are practically the same, although it was necessary to introduce
different values of R.

6.6.1.2 Ab initio electron energy calculations. While there are many methods for
predicting the relative stability of ordered structures, electron energy calculations
for predicting interaction parameters for the liquid is still a major problem.
Calculations of the heat of solution for disordered solutions falls in an intermediate
category. It is a surprising fact that it is at present still impossible to calculate the
melting point, or the entropy and enthalpy of fusion of the elements to any
reasonable degree of accuracy, which poses a major challenge to a full calculation
of any phase diagram by FP methods. One method to overcome this problem for
liquids is to assume that it will exhibit sro parameters based on the predominant
solid state structure(s) in the phase diagram (Pasturel et al. 1992).

Pasturel et al. (1985) and Colinet et al. (1985) have used a tight-binding model
which considers the moments of the density of states. The model provides an
estimate for the d electron transfer between the elements in an alloy/compound by
using the concept of partial density of states. The model is, however, simplified so
that neither atomic position or crystal structure is calculated in detail. The results
can therefore be considered to provide a good general prediction for disordered
phases but is independent of crystal structure. The reason why this works reasonably
well is because the magnitude of the fundamental electronic d-band effect for many
such alloys is substantially larger than the effect arising from differences in crystal
structure. More accurate results probably require the incorporation of directional
bonding (Pettifor et al. 1995) which can lead to highly composition-dependent
interaction parameters,

6.6.2 The prediction of thermodynamic properties for compounds

6.6.2.1 The concept of counter-phases. When a stable compound penetrates from a
binary into a ternary system, it may extend right across the system or exhibit only
limited solubility for the third element. In the latter case, any characterisation also
requires thermodynamic parameters to be available for the equivalent metastable
compound in one of the other binaries, These are known as counter-phases. Figure
6.16 shows an isothermal section across the Fe-Mo-B system (Pan 1992) which
involves such extensions for the binary borides. In the absence of any other guide-

lines it is necessary to use empirical methods, which have been well documented in
Kaufman and Bernstein (1970), and constitute a useful fitting procedure. Accurate
results can be obtained if there are some prior phase-boundary data for the ternary
system which can be used to validate the assumed thermodynamics of the counter-
phase. However, problems arise when there is little or no experimental information
and when the extension of the compound into the ternary is small. Further, when
multiple sublattice modelling is used (see Chapter 5) it may be necessary to input
thermodynamic properties for compounds which are compositionally far away from
the area of interest in the CALPHAD calculation. It is therefore desirable to have a
method of predicting the thermodynamic properties of as many counter-phases as
possible.

6.6.2.2 Structure maps. Attempts have been made to chart the occurrence of par-
ticular structures in relation to familiar parameters such as size, electronegativity
and electron concentration (Darken and Gurry 1953, Villars et al. 1989). Some of
these schemes have only limited applicability to particular areas of the periodic
table, but more recently there has been greater success through structure maps
which are based on the concept of a Mendeleev number (Pettifor 1985a). These
have been extended to ternary compounds (Pettifor 1985b) and give considerable
insight into the choice of structures which may be significant competitors in a given
multicomponent situation. Calculations which give more detailed energies of
various competing structures in particular regions of the map, such as for the Laves
phases (Ohta and Pettifor 1989) are now emerging with increased frequency.

6.6.2.3 The Miedema model and other semi-empirical methods. The Miedema
model was originally devised as a tool for merely predicting the sign of the heat of
solution at the equiatomic composition. Therefore Eq. (6.36) does not contain any
concentration-dependent terms (Miedema 1973, Miedema et al. 1973). However,
the treatment was extended in subsequent publications, and modifications were
made to include ordering contributions and asymmetric effects (Miedema et al.
1975, de Boer et al. 1988). Additional functions f(c%,, ch) and g(c4, cB, Vina, Vin)
were kept very simple and did not include additional parameters other than (V,,),
which had already been used to determine (ns).

where f(c4, ch) = cych(1 + 8(cych)”) and cy, etc., are surface concentrations.
These arise from the concept that in their ‘macroscopic atom’ model the enthalpy
effects are generated at the common interface of dissimilar atomic cells. Such an
expression contains only a limited degree of asymmetry and essentially use a very
primitive ordering model that does not even consider nearest-neighbour interactions
but assumes that Hora /Hoaisora is virtually a constant. Since there is no provision for
any crystallographic parameters it is impossible to make any predictions about the
relative stability compounds with different crystal structures at the same stoichio-
metry. A quantum-mechanical rationale of the Miedema approach has been
published by Pettifor (1979a), outlining its strengths and weaknesses.

Machlin (1974, 1977) developed a semi-empirical treatment which used a
constant set of nearest-neighbour interactions and was one of the earliest semi-
empirical attempts to obtain the relative enthalpies of formation between different
crystal structures. This successfully predicted the correct ground states in a
substantial number of cases, but the treatment was generally restricted to transition
metal combinations and a limited number of crystal structures.

6.6.2.4 Ab initio electron energy calculations. Some of the earliest electron energy
calculations were made for transition metals where it was noted that trends in
cohesive energy could be approximated to a very reasonable degree by considering
only the d-band electrons (Friedel 1969, Ducastelle and Cyrot-Lackman 1970).
Various means of representing the density of states were then applied in an attempt
to quantify this. Van der Rest et al. (1975) utilised the coherent potential approxi-
mation (CPA) method with off-diagonal disorder to compute the density of states
curve. This method was employed by Gautier ef al. (1975) and Ehrenreich and
Schwartz (1976) for extensive calculations of transition metal alloys. Later work by
Pettifor (1978, 1979b), Varma (1979) and Watson and Bennett (1981) extended the
d-band concept further and comparison with experimental enthalpies of formation
for equi-atomic compounds were quite reasonable, although there is a clear ten-
dency for the predictions to be too exothermic. They are also limited because they
are insensitive to crystal structure and, subsequently, give no predictions for meta-
stable compounds, Pseudo-potential calculations are also a method by which heats
of formation can be predicted (Hafner 1989, 1992). These work better for sp-
bonded compounds such as the alkali metal Laves phases (Hafner 1987) where
nearly free electron theory is well suited, but they are not so applicable to d-band
calculations which are necessary for transition metal alloys.

Electron energy calculations utilise methods which solve the Schrédinger
equation and start with the specification of the lattice space group taking into
account a wide variety of interatomic forces. It is therefore possible to make
calculations for a large group of ordered structures and calculate the difference in
enthalpy that arise from any specified change in crystallography at a given
composition for any combination of elements (Pettifor 1985a, Finnis et al. 1988).
Such calculations incorporate the effects of changes in band width, the centre of
gravity of the bands, various forms of hybridisation and can also include directional
bonding (Pettifor 1989, Phillips and Carlsson 1990, Pettifor et al. 1995).

Although there are inherent approximations in any electron energy calculation, it
is significant that this route now has a high success rate in predicting the correct
ground state amongst a large range of competing structures (Gautier 1989, Sluiter
and Turchi 1989, Nguyen-Manh ef al. 1995). In order to shorten the calculation
time these are often limited to those structures thought most likely to occur. This
can potentially lead to the omission of other contenders but algorithms have recently
been developed which can markedly extend the number of structures sampled and
remove such arbitrary limitations (Lu et al. 1991).

Electron energy calculations now offer a coherent explanation of trends observed
both across and down the periodic table and the grouping and overlaps observed in
structure maps. Of particular importance are the marked changes that occur on
moving to elements of higher atomic number, which means that some of the earlier
assumptions concerning similarities of behaviour for compounds of the 3d, 4d, and
5d elements (Kaufman and Bernstein 1970) have had to be revised. Quantum
mechanical effects also lead to significantly greater sinusoidal variations in stability
with atomic number and hence also to markedly greater asymmetry in the variation
of enthalpy of formation of similar structures in a given binary system.

6.7, SUMMARY

Despite a sometimes turbulent history a series of standard and effective lattice
stability values are now readily available for the majority of elements. Most of the
remaining areas of controversy concern structures which seem to be elastically
unstable or where the magnetic structure is uncertain. The relative stability of
different compounds seems to be taking a similar route, but clearly involves a much
wider range of structures. The availability of many different calculation routes has
led to numerous comparisons being made between the various calculated results
and whatever experimental information is available for the stable phases (Kaufman
1986, Birnie et al. 1988, Colinet et al. 1988, Watson et al. 1988, de Boer et al.
1988, Aldinger et al. 1995). Figure 6.17 shows that there is often good general
agreement for a given class of structures so that it is now possible to make a better
estimate for the enthalpies of unknown metastable compounds.

The success of earlier empirical schemes in predicting the sign and magnitude of
the enthalpy of formation can in part be attributed to making predictions for AB
compounds. This can hide asymmetrical effects which are more apparent when
other stoichiometries are considered. The empirical and semi-empirical schemes do

not have the capacity to handle a wide range of bonding characteristics without the
introduction of many additional parameters with arbitrary numerical values. This
much diminishes their predictive value as far as defining the relative stability of
counter-phases is concemed. The more sophisticated electron energy calculations
are now undoubtedly a better guide for the relative enthalpy of a much wider range
of structures and should be increasingly used as input data in any CALPHAD
optimisation. However, such calculations cannot predict the relative entropies of
the competing structures and this is still an area where an empirical approach is
required for the present.
