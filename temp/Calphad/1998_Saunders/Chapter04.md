# Chapter 4 - Experimental Determination of Thermodynamic Quantities and Phase Diagrams

## 4.1 INTRODUCTION

The intention of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the types of techniques which are available for determining phase diagrams and thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpies of formation, activities, heat capacities, etc. It is not intended to be comprehensive in its coverage of methods but requisite references are given in the chapter if the reader wishes to go more deeply into this area.

The first section concerning thermodynamic measurements will be divided into three parts after Kubaschewski et al. (1993). The first of these will deal with calorimetric techniques which offer probably the most versatile method for determining thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, enthalpies of formation/mixing, heat capacities, standard entropies etc. While calorimetric techniques are very powerful for establishing ‘integral’ and partial enthalpies, they are limited when dealing with quantities such as the partial Gibbs energy and its associated quantities, such as the activity and activity coefficient. The second and third subsections will therefore deal with methods for determining these quantities by gas phase equilibria and electromotive forces (EMF) respectively.

The second section will concentrate on methods of determining phase diagrams. The first part will examine non-isothermal methods, such as differential thermal analysis and cooling curve determinations, while the second will concentrate on isothermal methods, such as metallography, X-ray measurements, etc. The various limitations of both methods will be discussed and some novel techniques introduced.

## 4.2 EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THERMODYNAMIC QUANTITIES

### 4.2.1 Calorimetric methods

In principle, all of the thermodynamic quantities associated with pure substances can be measured using calorimeters which measure heat evolution and absorption arising either during heating and cooling of a substance, or from a reaction. The reaction can be a straightforward chemical one between two components or a phase transformation, for example, the austenite — ferrite transformation in a steel or the crystallisation of a glass. The reliability of a calorimeter is governed by a number of important factors, such as heat conduction, its own heat capacity, the efficiency by which heat is transferred between sample and calorimeter, and it cannot be suffi- ciently emphasised that the sound design and correct use of a calorimeter is critical when considering the reliability of the final result.

Broadly speaking calorimeters can be classified into four types (Kubaschewski et al. 1993):

(i) Isothermal calorimeters. In this calorimeter the temperature of the surrounding (\\(T\_{s}\\)) is equalised to the temperature of the calorimeter (\\(T\_{c}\\)); a good example is the Bunsen ice calorimeter.

(ii) Adiabatic calorimeters. In this case \\(T\_{s}=T\_{c}\\), but the temperature is not constant. These are mainly used for the determination of heat capacities.

(iii) Heat-flow calorimeters. These are adiabatic in nature but \\(T\_{s} - T\_{c}\\), is maintained constant instead of keeping \\(T\_{s}=T\_{c}\\).

(iv) Isoperibol calorimeters. In this case the enclosure of the calorimeter is held at a constant temperature and \\(T\_{c}\\) is measured at various stages during the reaction.

The isothermal and isoperibol calorimeters are well suited to measuring heat contents from which heat capacities may be subsequently derived, while the adiabatic and heat-flow calorimeters are best suited to the direct measurement of heat capacities and enthalpies of transformation.

#### 4.2.1.1 Measurement of enthalpy and heat capacity

Heat contents can be measured accurately by a number of techniques based on a ‘drop’ method. This involves heating the sample to a high temperature and dropping it directly into a calorimeter held at a lower temperature. The calorimeter then measures the heat evolved while the sample cools to the temperature of the calorimeter. The temperature at which the sample is initially heated is varied and a plot of Hy — Hoga.15 vs temperature is drawn (Fig. 4.1). Heat capacities can then be calculated using Eq. (3.9). A popular calorimeter for this is the diphenyl ether calorimeter (Hultgren et al. 1958, Davies and Pritchard 1972) but its temperature range is limited below about 1050 K.

More recently, calorimeters have been designed to extend the range of thismethod and a notable example has been the development of levitation calorimetry.This has led to the measurement of the heat contents of a number of high-melting-point elements such as W (Arpachi and Frohberg 1984), Mo (Treverton and Margave1970, Berezin et al. 1971, Betz and Frohberg 1980a) and Nb (Betz and Frohberg1980b) where the latter is shown in Fig. 4.2. The advantage of an electromagneticlevitation method is that the sample can be held at temperature without contact withan external holding device and pyrometry is utilised as the technique for measuringtemperature. The above ‘drop’ techniques suffer from the disadvantage that \\C\_{p}\\ values are derived from the heat content curves and are not directly measured. They are not sensitive enough to accurately measure small changes in energy associated with, for example, order/disorder transformations or magnetic transitions. In these cases a direct method of measuring heat capacity is preferable, such as an adiabatic calorimeter.

Figure 4.2, Heat content of Nb measured (\\(\bullet{}\\)) by Betz and Frohberg (1980b) with results (\\(\times{}\\)) of Sheindlin et al. (1972) also shown.

The principle behind an adiabatic calorimeter is the measurement of the heat absorbed or evolved by the sample during a continuous heating process. This requires that the calorimeter is stringently calibrated so that its heat capacity is known accurately. Any deviation from this heat capacity is then due to the heat capacity of the sample. If the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the calorimeter is high in comparison to that for the sample, then problems with accuracy will occur. Correct design minimises this problem and, for example, in a high-temperature adiabatic calorimeter (Sale 1970) approximately 90% of the energy supplied to the specimen heater was used to heat the specimen and only 10% in heating the heater assembly and thermocouples. This method can yield very reliable results but transformations must occur fast enough so that equilibrium is continuously achieved during heating, otherwise reliability of measurement will be degraded. Recent advances have been made in high-temperature regimes using a ‘pulse’ heating method. This can be done by heating the sample using a well-defined electrical ‘pulse’ of energy (Cezairliyan 1969) and monitoring the specimen temperature closely to calculate the heat capacity.

##### 4.2.1.2 Measurement of enthalpies of transformation.

While enthalpies of transformation can be measured using calorimeters (see for example Fig. 4.2) other techniques can also be applied such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). DSC offers an immediate quantification of the heat absorbed/evolved during a transformation and, as such, is much more widely used for measuring thermodynamic properties during phase transformations. In DSC the sample and reference material are heated separately and conditions are maintained such that the temperature of the sample, \\(T\_{s}\\), is kept equal to that of the reference material, \\(T\_{r}\\). The heat that is required to maintain this balance is then a direct measurement of the heat evolved/absorbed during the transformation and is plotted as a function of temperature. Integration of the area within the DSC peak is then a direct measurement of the enthalpy of transformation.

The principle behind DTA is measurement of the temperature difference between the sample of interest and a reference sample which is inert during a heating and/or cooling cycle and whose thermal behaviour is accurately known. A typical configuration would be that the sample and reference material are placed in separate chambers within a heating block which is contained within the furnace. A thermocouple is then placed in both chambers directly in contact with the sample and connected in series. The furnace and sample block are then heated and the temperature of the sample and reference material monitored. There is a difference in temperature between the sample and reference material which is a function of (1) their different \\(C\_{p}\\), values and (2) the heat absorbed or evolved due to a transformation. This temperature difference is recorded continuously and the area of the DTA peak is then proportional to the heat evolved or absorbed during the transformation. It is not possible to directly obtain the enthalpy of transformation using DTA; this must be done by careful calibration at each sample to obtain reliable thermodynamic information. In practice DTA is not as powerful as DSC for obtaining enthalpies of transformation. However, because of its sensitivity to temp- erature changes in the sample, it is very useful for determining the temperatures for phase changes, i.e., liquidus temperatures and melting points.

The techniques above are very useful for looking at pure substances or alloys of a known composition. However, to obtain enthalpies of formation it is necessary to examine some form of reaction which involves two or more starting materials. Some form of reaction between these materials occurs and there is a subsequent heat evolution/absorption associated with the reaction.

The problems associated with direct reaction calorimetry are mainly associated with (1) the temperature at which reaction can occur; (2) reaction of the sample with its surroundings; and (3) the rate of reaction which usually takes place in an uncontrolled manner. For low melting elements such as Zn, Pb, etc., reaction may take place quite readily below 500°C. Therefore, the materials used to construct the calorimeter are not subjected to particularly high temperatures and it is easy to select a suitably non-reactive metal to encase the sample. However, for materials such as carbides, borides and many intermetallic compounds these temperatures are insufficient to instigate reaction between the components of the compound and the materials of construction must be able to withstand high temperatures. It seems simple to construct the calorimeter from some refractory material. However, problems may arise if its thermal conductivity is very low. It is then difficult to control the heat flow within the calorimeter if some form of adiabatic or isothermal condition needs to be maintained, which is further exacerbated if the reaction rates are fast.

One of the simplest calorimetric methods is ‘combustion bomb calorimetry’. In essence this involves the direct reaction of a sample material and a gas, such as O or F, within a sealed container and the measurement of the heat which is produced by the reaction. As the heat involved can be very large, and the rate of reaction very fast, the reaction may be explosive, hence the term ‘combustion bomb’. The calorimeter must be calibrated so that heat absorbed by the calorimeter is well characterised and the heat necessary to initiate reaction taken into account. The technique has no constraints concerning adiabatic or isothermal conditions but is severely limited if the amount of reactants are small and/or the heat evolved is small. It is also not particularly suitable for intermetallic compounds where combustion is not part of the process during its formation. Its main use is in materials thermo- chemistry where it has been used in the determination of enthalpies of formation of carbides, borides, nitrides, etc.

Kubaschewski and Dench (1955) designed a direct-reaction calorimeter which allowed them to systematically measure the enthalpies of formation of a variety of transition metal-aluminides and it is somewhat similar in concept to the ‘combustion bomb’ calorimeter. The method involves electrically heating the unreacted metal powders of the transition metal and aluminium to a temperature where reaction takes place rapidly. The amount of electrical energy needed to do this is then recorded. The maximum temperature of reaction is measured and the calorimeter allowed to cool to room temperature. The calorimeter, with the reacted sample, is then re-heated to the maximum temperature recorded during the actual reaction and the amount of electrical energy to do this recorded. The difference between the electrical energy input during the reaction run and the subsequent calibration run is the energy given off by the reaction. This technique was exten- sively applied and subsequent work has shown that results obtained by this method were, in the main, quite reliable.

Adiabatic calorimeters have also been used for direct-reaction calorimetry. Kubaschewski and Walter (1939) designed a calorimeter to study intermetallic compounds up to 700°C. The procedure involved dropping compressed powders of two metals into the calorimeter and maintaining an equal temperature between the main calorimetric block and a surrounding jacket of refractory alloy. Any rise in temperature due to the reaction of the metal powders in the calorimeter was compensated by electrically heating the surrounding jacket so that its temperature remained the same as the calorimeter. The heat of reaction was then directly a func- tion of the electrical energy needed to maintain the jacket at the same temperature as the calorimeter. One of the main problems with this calorimeter was the low thermal conductivity of the refractory alloy which meant that it was very difficult to maintain true adiabatic conditions.

Kleppa (1955) overcame this problem by using aluminium as the material for the calorimeter and surrounding jacket. This substantially improved its ability to maintain adiabatic conditions and it was successfully used for more than 10 years. However, the main limitation was that its temperature capability was governed by the low melting point of aluminium, which meant that its main use was for reactions which took place below ~500°C.

Recently, Gachon and Hertz (1983) devised a calorimeter for measuring the enthalpy of formation of a variety of intermetallic compounds in the temperature range 800-1800 K (Gachon et al. 1985). A calorimetric cell, consisting of 17 Pt/Rh thermocouples in series, surrounds a working crucible where a sample of com- pacted elemental powders is held. The assembly is heated to a temperature where reaction takes place and the signal from the calorimetric cell is recorded. The integral of the signal from the calorimetric cell as a function of time is proportional to the heat of reaction. With calibration it is then possible to obtain the heat formation of the compound or alloy of interest. A similar device was also constructed by Kleppa and Topor (1989). The main drawbacks to this method are reaction of the sample with the crucible and possible incomplete reaction. While Gachon ef al. (1985) had significant problems with reactivity of the crucible and sample, they appeared to achieve complete reaction in alloys based on transition metals with Ti, Zr and Hf. However, Kleppa (1994) found substantial problems if the operating temperature was too low and the reaction enthalpy small. It was still possible, however, to obtain reliable results for an extensive range of borides, germanides and aluminides and many of these have been reported by Kleppa (1994).

Another method to obtain enthalpies of formation of compounds is by solute-solvent drop calorimetry. This method was pioneered by Tickner and Bever (1952) where the heat formation of a compound could be measured by dissolving it in liquid Sn. The principle of the method is as follows. If the heat evolved in the dis solution of compound AB is measured, and the equivalent heat evolved in the dissolution of the equivalent amount of pure A and B is known or measured, the difference provides the enthalpy of formation of the compound AB. Kleppa (1962) used this method for determining enthalpies of formation of a number of Cu-, Ag- and Au-based binaries and further extended the use of the method to high- melting-point materials with a more generalised method.

This can be demonstrated for the determination of the enthalpy of formation of LaBg by reaction with Pt. In this case, although the melting points of Pt and \\(LaB\_{6}\\) are 1769°C and 2715°C respectively, an alloy of the two will produce a low- melting-point liquid. Knowledge of the phase diagram is then essential, so that the likely temperature and composition range of the liquid region formed on alloying Pt and LaBg is known. In this case a mixture of 0.72 moles of Pt and 0.04 moles of \\(LaB\_{6}\\) will become fully liquid at 1400 K. Therefore, if the heats involved in the following reactions are known

(1) \\( 0.72 Pt \left( s,298 \right) + 0.04 LaB\_{6} \left(s, 298 \right) = Pt\_{0.72}La\_{0.04}B\_{0.24} \left(l, 1400 \right) \\)

(2) \\( 0.72 Pt \left( s,298 \right) + 0.04 La \left(s, 298 \right) + 0.24 B \left( s, 298 \right) = Pt\_{0.72}La\_{0.04}B\_{0.24} \left(l, 1400 \right) \\)

the difference can be used to define the enthalpy of formation of \\( LaB\_{6} \\).

### 4.2.2 Gas phase equilibria techniques

The general field of measuring thermodynamic quantities using gas-phase methods is based simply on Eq. (3.55) where the activity of component i (a;) is equal to the vapour pressure of i in the alloy divided by the equilibrium vapour pressure of pure i,

$$
a\_{i} = \frac{p\_{i}}{p\_{i}^{\circ}} \quad\text{(4.1)} 
$$

Hence all techniques rely in some way on measuring the vapour pressure of the component of interest. There are a number of methods which can be applied and these can be broadly broken down into three categories.

#### 4.2.2.1 Static methods for measurement of vapour pressures.

An experimental rig would typically contain the sample material of interest held in a container at the required temperature. At least two possibilities then exist for measuring the vapour pressure. The first is to seal the system and in some way measure the vapour pressure. Typically a container holding the sample is evacuated and equilibrium is reached with the vapour given off by the sample. The technique for measuring the vapour pressure can be a direct one, for example by a mercury manometer, or by a more indirect method such as a radiation absorption method. The absorption method utilises the fact that atoms or molecules of the various vapour species have characteristic absorption wavelengths. If a source such as a light emitter can then provide a wavelength corresponding to this characteristic wavelength the intensity of the light transmitted through the gas can be used as a measure of the amount vapour species with that characteristic wavelength. Reviews of on static and quasistatic methods have been made by Clopper et al. (1967) and Norman and Winchell (1970).

#### 4.2.2.2 The dew-point and non-isothermal isopiestic methods.

These are methods where a temperature gradient is maintained between a sample held at a high temperature and a pure metal which is held at a lower temperature. In the dew-point method the vapour pressure of the volatile component is determined by direct observation of the temperature at which it condenses.

#### 4.2.2.3 The Knudsen effusion and Langmuir free-evaporation methods.

In both of these cases the rate of vaporisation of a substance in vacuum is measured and the following formula is utilised

$$
p = \frac{m}{tA} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi{}RT}{M}} \quad\text{(4.2)} 
$$

where p is the vapour pressure, m is the mass of the vapour species with a molecular weight M which evaporates from an area, A, in a time, t.

In the Knudsen effusion method a substance is enclosed in a sealed container into which a very small hole is drilled. This hole must be knife-edged and the mean free path of the vapour must be 10 times the diameter of the hole. In its simplest form an experiment proceeds as follows. The Knudsen cell, with sample in it, is carefully weighed and then heated in a vacuum at the requisite temperature for a set time. The cell is then re-weighed and the weight loss is measured. However, it is now more usual to continuously measure the weight of the cell. If the molecular weight and surface area of the sample is known the vapour pressure can be found.

Unfortunately, the method is not straightforward. It is necessary to consider a number of other factors, such as preferential depletion of a species from the surface of the sample, reaction of the gas with the cell itself, and the effusion of the gas which does not always follow ideal behaviour. Recently much work has been done to improve accuracy through better understanding of the method itself, and much early work pre-1960 is now considered to be unreliable (Komarek 1972). The method also relies on knowledge of the molecular weight of the vapour species and there may be more than one species involved. To this end the method is now often linked with mass spectroscopy (Komarek 1972, Kubaschewski et al. 1993) so that composition of the gas is better understood.

In the Langmuir free-evaporation method, the sample is suspended freely in a vacuum system with no container surrounding it. As very low levels of vapour pres sure can be measured it has advantages over the Knudsen method where the lower limit is about 107 atm. (Kubaschewski et al. 1993). It is therefore more useful in materials with high sublimation energies and therefore inherently low vapour pressures. It has a further advantages in that there is no container with which to react, but there are more significant problems associated with temperature measurement.

### 4.2.3 Electromotive force measurements

The electromotive force (EMF) generated by electrochemical cells can be used to measure partial Gibbs energies which, like vapour pressure measurements, distinguishes these methods from other techniques that measure integral thermo- dynamic quantities. Following Moser (1979), a typical cell used to obtain results on Zn-In-Pb is represented in the following way:

$$
Zn (Liq) \; | \; ZnCl\_{2} \; in \; (LiCl-KCl) \; Eut \; | \; Zn-In-Pb \; (Liq).
$$

In this case a fused salt electrolyte, incorporating ZnClz dissolved in a eutectic mixture of LiCl and KCl, is used to determine the activity gradient between pure liquid Zn and a ternary Zn-In-Pb alloy, also in the liquid state. The EMF arises from the potential between pure Zn at unit activity to Zn in the alloy where the activity has a value, a;. The ruling equation then becomes

$$
\bar{G}\_{1} - \bar{G}\_{2} = - nFE = RT \log{}\_{e} a\_{1} \quad\text{(4.3)} 
$$

where n is the charge, F the Faraday constant and the other symbols have their
usual meaning. For many alloys the relation between EMF and temperature is linear and, in the simplest case, changes in partial enthalpy and entropy can be readily calculated by the following equations:

$$
\Delta{}\bar{H}\_{1} =  nF \left( \frac{dE}{dT} - E \right) \quad\text{(4.4)} 
$$

and

$$
\Delta{}\bar{S}\_{1} =  nF \left( \frac{dE}{dT} \right) \quad\text{(4.5)} 
$$

These partial quantities may either be used directly or transformed by means of the Gibbs—-Duhem equation in the overall assessment of the system in question (Moser 1979).

The principle of the method is simple, but many factors have to be considered before a given cell will yield reproducible and accurate results (Kubaschewski et al. 1993, Komarek 1973, Komarek and Ipser 1984). These include the choice and preparation of the electrolyte, the materials of construction of the cell, as well as scrupulous attention to experimental arrangements. First and foremost the basic equations hold only for reversible cells and assume that the only mechanism of conduction in the electrolyte is via a single ionic species. The best test for the reversibility and proper functioning of the working cell is to check that the same EMF values are obtained both for the increase and decrease in several repeated temperature runs and/or by placing the same materials in both half-cells to obtain a null result. However, at high temperatures most electrolytes generally also feature an element of electronic conduction, so that it is necessary to introduce a transport number (\\(t\_{ion}\\)) into Eq. (4.3), otherwise the measured EMF will overestimate the ionic component. To allow for reference electrodes whose activities are not unity, this equation should be expanded to

$$
\bar{G}\_{2} - \bar{G}\_{1} = - nFE = RTt\_{ion} \log{}\_{e} \frac{a\_{2}}{a\_{1}} \quad\text{(4.6)} 
$$

Some general principles allow the best range of operation to be determined for solid electrolytes. n-type conduction is associated with low oxygen pressures, followed at higher pressures by a regime of ionic conduction, with near ideal transport numbers, while at still higher pressures the overall conduction pattern is increasingly associated with hole conduction. Also, the region of ionic conduction is most dominant when the diffusion coefficient of oxygen is high. The optimum choice of electrolyte can therefore be matched to the conditions of the study. Some cells employ a series of electrolytes in contact with each other in order to cope with wide ranges of oxygen activity and to minimise reactions at the relevant electrodes, but further terms need then to be added to take into account junction potentials (Kubaschewski et al. 1993).

Both liquid and solid electrolytes can be used, ranging from molten halides, such as a eutectic mixture of LiCl and KCl, to very sophisticated solid-state electrolytes such as calcia or yttria stabilised zirconia, CSZ, YSZ, which are conductors of oxygen ions.

$$
Pt < Ni, NiO > \; | \; CaO-ZrO\_{2} \; | \; < Fe, FeO > Pt.
$$

Cells of this type were first introduced by Kiukkola and Wagner (1957). \\(\beta{}\\)-alumina has been increasingly used, largely in relation to the diffusion of sodium ions, but it can also be used to study the diffusion of Ag and Cu. Calcium floride, saturated with calcium sulphide, and other combinations, including yttrium sulphide, have been suggested for the measurement of sulphur potentials in oxidising environments above 500°C (Kleykamp 1983). A new class of electrolyte, which conducts S or C and operate above 1000°C, has been developed by Alcock and Li (1990) utilising a dispersed phase, in which the fluorine gradient can be measured indirectly, following previous work on three-phase equilibria (Jacob and Iwase 1982).

The overall accuracy of EMF methods requires that the voltage measurement should be carried out without the passage of current through the cell. Therefore, either the measuring circuit should have as high a resistance as possible, or alternatively measurements can be carried out under different conditions and extrapolated to zero current (Rose et al. 1948). It is also very important to avoid any parasitic voltages such as those which may occur from thermoelectric effects arising from temperature gradients (Kubaschewski et al. 1993). Other factors that enter into the reproducibility of the results is the necessity to ensure that the electrolyte remains uncontaminated from reaction with the materials used for construction of the cell, including the electrodes. To avoid displacement reactions the metal, which acts as the reference electrode, must be less noble than the other components of the investigated alloy. Other problems to be avoided are reaction with the atmosphere or water vapour and any changes in concentration due to high vapour pressure in the temperature range of measurements.

Assuming all these factors have been taken into account, it should be possible to make measurements to within 1 mV (Charette and Flengas 1968). The accuracy decreases at very low partial pressures of oxygen, when electronic contributions play a more significant role, and problems in design are greatly increased. Dench and Kubaschewski (1969) were successful in refining their experimental system and obtaining a precision of 0.2 mV using the solid state cell

$$
Pt \; | \; Co, CoO \; | \; ZrO\_{2}-Ca0 \; | \; Ni, NiO \; | \; Pt.
$$

Bergman and Agren (1984) used a similar cell to study the properties of MnO-NiO and also conducted a detailed analysis of the standard deviation of measured EMFs as a function of composition, showing that this could vary substantially across the system.

If results are required at very high temperatures, as in experiments related to steel making, even short-term survival makes severe demands on the construction of the cell (Komarek and Ipser 1984). However, oxygen concentration cells have been employed with molten ionic slags to determine the thermodynamics of oxide formation in iron between 1500-1600°C (Kay 1979). Other applications include the use of YSZ for studies of semiconducting systems (Sears and Anderson 1989, Lee et al. 1992).

In conclusion, the EMF method can provide good accuracy for activity and activity coefficients and, therefore, offers a useful alternative to vapour pressure measurements (Jacob et al. 1973). However, enthalpy and entropy values calculated from slopes dE/dT can be associated with much higher errors (Moser 1979). It is therefore highly desirable to combine information from EMF measurements with other data, such as calorimetric information, in order to obtain reliable entropies. Such a combination of EMF and calorimetric results may completely change results for certain systems. For instance, investigations on the liquid Mg-In system gave positive values of \\( \Delta{}\bar{S}\_{Mg}^{xs}\\), when calculated using only EMF data but, in combination with calorimetric studies, resulted in negative values of \\( \Delta{}\bar{S}\_{Mg}^{xs}\\).

## 4.3. EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF PHASE DIAGRAMS

It is an interesting consequence of CALPHAD methods that, while it is possible to make very accurate predictions for the phase equilibria of multi-component systems if accurate thermodynamic characterisations of the requisite binary and temary sub-systems are available, it is in reality impossible to make predictions for the phase diagrams of binary systems to any degree of accuracy which would be acceptable for practical purposes. This means that experimental determination of phase diagrams, particularly binary and ternary systems, is a critical factor in the development of CALPHAD methods. The aim of this section is to give a brief introduction into some methods of measuring phase diagrams giving a few specific examples of practical work and, as such, is not intended to provide a compre- hensive coverage of phase diagram determination. Critical reviews of binary systems by Hansen and Anderko (1958), Elliott (1965) and Shunk (1969) and now the Journal of Phase Equilibria, and its predecessor publication The Bulletin of Alloy Phase Diagrams published by ASM International, provide the reader with extensive publications conceming phase diagrams with numerous references to original work.

### 4.3.1 Non-isothermal techniques

Non-isothermal techniques are basically those where a sample is heated or cooled through a transformation and some property of the alloy changes as a consequence of the transformation. Most usually it is the heat effect associated with the transformation which is measured, but other effects such as magnetic or dilatometric changes can be measured.

It should be noted that these techniques are inherently non-equilibrium in nature in that it is often extremely difficult for a complete equilibrium transformation to take place during the heating or cooling cycle. However, having made this observation, techniques such as DTA have been very successful in defining positions of certain phase boundaries such as liquidus temperatures and invariant reactions such as eutectics. The reason for this is that it is often the start of transformation which is measured rather than the complete transformation itself. This can be seen for a liquidus point where an inflection in a cooling curve defines the onset of the solidification process (Fig. 4.3). This is more nucleation controlled rather than growth controlled and if the efficacy of potential nucleation agents in the system is high and the cooling rate is slow, of the order of 1°C min7!, then very accurate results may be obtained. The method can be enhanced by plotting 6T/dt instead of T.

However, the situation is different if one considers the total transformation, including the solidus and peritectic type reactions where substantial solid state diffusion is needed to obtain complete equilibrium. Unless very slow cooling rates are used, or some further control mechanism utilised in the experiment, it is quite common to observe significant undercooling below the equilibrium temperature of transformation. The following sections will briefly describe determinations of phase diagrams where non-isothermal techniques have been successfully used, and possible problems associated with non-equilibrium effects will be discussed.

#### 4.3.1.1 Thermal analysis techniques. 

The Cu-Sn system is an excellent example of what can be achieved with simple cooling curve measurements and it all also is one of the first quantitative determinations of a liquidus of a phase diagram. Heycock and Neville (1890, 1897) took liquid alloys and cooled them through the liquidus and measured the temperature using simple thermocouples. The time at each temperature measurement was also noted and cooling curves of temperature vs time graphically drawn. An inflection point determined the onset of solidification (Fig. 4.3) and this defined the liquidus. Figure 4.4 shows the series of liquidus temperatures measured for the whole of the Cu-Sn system. It is remarkable to note that the quality of their results has more than stood the test of time and a century later they are still considered as one of the defining sets of experiments for this system (Hansen and Anderko 1958, Saunders and Miodownik 1990).


Figure 4.4. Liquidus points for Cu-Sn determined by Heycock and Neville (1890, 1897).



More advanced techniques are now available and section 4.2.1.2 described differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). DTA, in particular, is widely used for determination of liquidus and solidus points and an excellent case of its application is in the In-Pb system studied by Evans and Prince (1978) who used a DTA technique after Smith (1940). In this method the rate of heat transfer between specimen and furnace is maintained at a constant value and cooling curves determined during solidification. During the solidification process itself cooling rates of the order of 1.25°C min\\(^{-1}\\) were used. This particular paper is of great interest in that it shows a very precise determination of the liquidus, but clearly demonstrates the problems associated with determining solidus temperatures.

Figure 4.5 shows the liquidus and solidus for In-Pb determined during cooling from the liquid; the solidus, in this case, is a non-equilibrium boundary. This was demonstrated by Evans and Prince (1978) when they annealed as solidified alloys for several hours just below their measured solidus. On re-heating melting occurred at a higher temperature than had been measured by DTA. The samples were then annealed for several hours just below the new measured melting temperature before being heated until melting was just observed again. The cycle was repeated until the solidus temperature became reproducible and the temperature then plotted as the true solidus. This is compared with the ‘apparent solidus’ on the initial cooling experiment in Fig. 4.5. This paper shows the problems that can occur with measurements using non-isothermal methods but also shows how these can be overcome to provide true equilibrium values.

#### 4.3.1.2 Chemical potential techniques. 

Phase diagrams can be determined by ‘chemical potential’ methods such as EMF. In this case the activity of one or both of the components is measured during a cooling or heating cycle and a series of characteristic breaks define phase boundaries. Figure 4.6 shows a series of Al-Sn alloys (Massart et al. 1965) where the EMF has been measured over a temperature range of 350-950°C. They characteristically show a break at the melting point of Al where the Al reference electrode solidifies. On further cooling the electrode voltage falls to zero when the Al-liquidus is reached and this defines the equilibrium liquidus. Work done at the same laboratory by Massart et al. (1966) on Al-in and by Martin-Garin et al. (1966) further demonstrated the applicability of the method to Al alloys. This technique is potentially powerful as it is possible to define both the thermodynamic properties of the system as well as the phase dia- gram. Further, the point at which the phase boundary is reached is unambiguously identified, whereas in some thermal analysis techniques this point is not always clearly defined.

#### 4.3.1.3 Magnetic susceptibility measurements. 

Magnetic susceptibility measurement is an interesting technique for determining phase boundaries in magnetic systems as there is a distinct change in magnetic properties during a phase transition. In this technique the alloy is suspended on a pendulum and a magnetic field is applied. The sample is then heated or cooled through the phase transition and the sample is deflected from its position due to the change in its inherent magnetism. The magnetic field is then altered by changing the applied current and the pendulum brought back to its original position. The magnetic susceptibility (x) is then defined as

$$
\chi{} = \left( \frac{K}{m} \right) I^{2} \quad\text{(4.7)} 
$$

where K is a constant, m is the mass of the sample and J is the compensating current. The magnetic susceptibility is then plotted as a function of temperature and sharp changes can be seen. Figure 4.7 shows a plot of x vs temperature for a Fe- 0.68at%Nb alloy (Ferrier et al. (1964)) where the phase boundaries are delineated very clearly. These results were then combined with DTA measurements for the liquidus to define the Fe-Nb phase diagram between 1200 and 1550°C (Ferrier et al. (1964)). Other examples of the use of the magnetic susceptibility technique can be found in Fe-P (Wachtel et al. 1963) and Fe-Si (Ubelacker 1965).

#### 4.3.1.4 Resistivity methods. 

This is a simple technique by which the resistivity of an alloy is measured as a function of temperature. As for the case of magnetic susceptibility, quite distinct changes in resistivity occur during phase changes, and it is a relatively simple matter to measure these changes during a heating or cooling cycle. Figure 4.8 shows a plot of resistivity vs temperature for a Al-12.6at%Li alloy from Costas and Marshall (1962) and a clear transition at the solubility limit of the alloy is observed.

#### 4.3.1.5 Dilatometric methods. 

This can be a sensitive method and relies on the different phases taking part in the phase transformation having different coefficients of thermal expansion. The expansion/contraction of a sample is then measured by a dilatometer. Cahn ef al. (1987) used dilatometry to examine the order—disorder transformation in a number of alloys in the Ni-Al-Fe system. Figure 4.9 shows an expansion vs temperature plot for a \\( \left( Ni\_{79.9} Al\_{20.1} \right)\_{0.87}Fe\_{0.13} \\) alloy where a transition from an ordered \\(L1\_{2}\\) compound (\\(\gamma^{\prime{}}\\)) to a two-phase mixture of (\\(\gamma^{\prime{}}\\)) and a Ni-rich f.c.c._Al phase (\\\gamma{}\\) occurs. The method was then used to determine the \\( \gamma^{\prime{}} / \left( \gamma{} + \gamma^{\prime{}} \right) \\) phase boundary as a function of Fe content, at a constant Ni/Al ratio, and the results are shown in Fig. 4.10. The technique has been used on numerous other occasions, for example in Co-Fe (Masumoto 1926) and Cd-Li (Grube et al. 1932), usually for solid-state transformations.

### 4.3.2 Isothermal techniques

Isothermal methods are inherently closer to equilibrium as the sample can be left at temperature for substantial periods to allow equilibrium to be reached. However, in practice it can still be difficult to know the point at which this occurs. In some cases equilibrium can be reached rapidly, as can be seen for the \\( \gamma^{\prime{}} / \left( \gamma{} + \gamma^{\prime{}} \right) \\) boundary in Ni-Al above 1000°C which has been well established by many workers (see for example Fig. 4.1 in Saunders (1996)). However, in other systems such as Ni-Nb some considerable doubt existed as to the exact placement of the Ni solvus line with Ni;Nb even though there had been a large number of experimental determinations (see for example Nash (1986) and Okamoto (1992)). There is no easy answer as to how long it is necessary to hold a sample at any given temperature to ensure equilibrium is reached; however, some simple type of diffusion analysis can be used as a first approximation. For example, a minimum holding time can be defined by the diffusion distance at temperature being greater than the grain size of the sample. In principle some of non-isothermal methods can be used in an isothermal way. In this case the composition is varied, rather than temperature, and a property such as EMF measured as a function of concentration.

The accuracy of some isothermal techniques, particularly those that rely on observation of phases, is limited by the number of different compositions that are prepared. For example, if two samples are separated by a composition of 2at%, and one is single-phase while the other two-phase, then formally the phase boundary can only be defined to within an accuracy of 2at%. This makes isothermal tech- niques more labour intensive than some of the non-isothermal methods. However, because it is now possible to directly determine compositions of phases by techniques such as electron microprobe analysis (EPMA), a substantially more quantitative exposition of the phase equilibria is possible.

#### 4.3.2.1 Metallography. 

This is one of the best established methods for determining phase diagrams. In principle some form of optical microscopy is used to charac- terise the microstructure of the alloy and define whether it is single-phase or two- phase, etc. Because of the simplicity of preparing an optical sample, usually some form of grinding and polishing technique, it is very economic. There can be complications associated with the preparation of the polished surface, for example the use of the correct chemical etching medium. However, handbooks exist which detail etches and procedures for a wide range of materials types. Metallographic techniques do limit the accuracy of phase boundary and determination but they can lead to a quite rapid determination of the general form of the phase diagram. To demonstrate this Fig. 4.11 shows metallographic results from an experimental determination of the solid-state region of the Mo—Re system (Knapton 1958-59).


Figure 4.11, Equilibrium phase diagram for the Mo-Re system after Knapton
(1958-59),


The previous paragraph has considered only optical methods, mainly for historical reasons, and the fact that the majority of phase-diagram work has probably been done using optical techniques. However, electron microscopy can be used instead, which has the considerable advantage that resolution is greatly increased. Further, the use of backscattered electron images can provide an immediate qualitative delineation of phases. As the image is controlled by the composition of the various phases, phases which contain higher levels of heavy elements appear light and conversely phases with lighter elements appear dark.

#### 4.3.2.2 X-rays. 

In some ways this is an even simpler method of determining a phase diagram as sample preparation can be easy. The sample is placed in some form of X-ray diffractometer and its characteristic X-ray pattern obtained. If the crystal structure of the phases is known, the identification of phase fields can be rapid and reliable. X-ray methods do not tend to be a primary method for determination of phase diagrams and are more often used to support some other technique such metallography. In this context there are two further uses for X-ray methods. The first is to do with identification of crystal structure, the other with a more exact determination of phase boundaries using lattice parameter measurement.

Identification of unknown crystal structures and determination of phase fields by X-rays can be problematical if the characteristic patterns of the various phases are quite similar, for example in some b.c.c._A2-based ordered phases in noble-metal-based alloys. However, in many cases the characteristic patterns of the phases can be quite different and, even if the exact structure is not known, phase fields can still be well established. Exact determination of phase boundaries is possible using lattice-parameter determination and this is a well-established method for identifying solvus lines for terminal solid solutions. The technique simply requires that the lattice parameter of the phase is measured as a function of composition across the phase boundary. The lattice parameter varies across the single-phase field but in the two-phase field becomes constant. Figure 4.12 shows such a phase-boundary determination for the HfC\\(\_{\left(1-x\right)}\\) phase where results at various temperatures were used to define the phase boundary as a function of temperature (Rudy 1969). As can be seen, the position of is defined exactly and the method can be used to identify phase fields across the whole composition range.

#### 4.3.2.3, Quantitative determination of phase compositions in multi-phase fields.

This topic can cover a broad range of techniques but, in practice, usually means measurement by electron microscopy in some form. The measurement of composition using characteristic X-rays given off when a sample is bombarded by high-energy electrons was pioneered by Castaing (1952). His initial instrumentation utilised optical methods to position the focused electrons but, later, as imaging using secondary and backscattered electrons became possible, resolution levels became sufficient to measure compositions of phases in actual heat-treated samples. Some of the earliest such work dates from the early 1960s, for example in the study of solid-state-phase equilibria in the Nb-Sn system (Wyman et al. 1962, Levinstein and Buehler 1964, Schadler et al. 1964).

The most significant advantage of these more quantitative methods is that, in a binary system, only one sample is needed to determine the position of both phase boundaries in a two-phase field. Further, if the alloy lies in the two-phase field over a wide range of temperatures, it is feasible that only one alloy need be used to fix the phase boundaries over this range of temperature. In a ternary system the analogous position is found with three-phase fields and, as these also define the limiting tie-lines of the three sets of two-phase fields, substantial information can be gained from the accurate determination of only one alloy. More recently transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used which is particularly valuable when microstructures are very fine as, for example, found in \\(\gamma{}\\)TiAl alloys (Chen et al. 1994).

Quantitative analysis can now be performed at an even finer level using atom probe and field ion microscopy techniques. In these methods samples are prepared with sharp tips (radius 10-50 nm) which are subjected to high positive voltage, giving rise to high electrical fields at the tip surface. Pulses of electrical energy are then superimposed which causes the surface atoms to be vapourised and ionised. The atoms are then collected and identified using sophisticated measuring devices. As atoms are removed layer by layer this means that some spatial resolution is possible and distinct changes can be seen as phase boundaries are crossed. Such methods have been used with particular success in Ni-based superalloys (Blavette et al. 1988, Duval et al. 1994). More recently these techniques have been expanded so that a 3D reconstruction of the tip can be made showing the position of various phases (Blavette et al. 1993).

#### 4.3.2.4 Sampling/equilibriation methods. 

The sampling method considers mainly equilibria involving the liquid phase where an alloy is held in a liquid + solid region until equilibrium is considered to be reached. Some of the liquid is then removed and its composition measured, thus defining the liquidus composition. The method relies on ensuring that the liquid and solid are sufficiently separated so that only the liquid is removed. This can usually be done straightforwardly as the density of the liquid and solid are different and gravity is then sufficient to provide the separation. Such methods have proved successful in determining the liquidus compositions of a number of Al-alloys where solubility levels are low due to the formation of high melting Al-rich intermetallics. Such systems cause problems in DTA experiments as liquidus slopes can be steep and the amount of solid formed is very small. Consequently the heat effect associated with the transformation is small and the exact point of the liquidus is difficult to determine.

A novel technique for the accurate determination of tie-lines in liquid/solid two-phase fields was first used by Willemin et al. (1986) in the Ni-Al-Ta system. The technique relies on holding an alloy just below its liquidus and quenching. The centre of the dendrite is then the part that was in equilibrium with the liquid at the temp- erature of holding. Microprobe analysis is subsequently made across the primary dendrite arms and composition profiles determined. The composition at the centre of the dendrite is clearly located in the concentration profiles by either maxima, when \\(x^{sol} > x^{liq}\\), or minima, when \\(x^{sol} < x^{liq}\\), This technique has also been used with good success in Ni-Al-Ti (Willemin and Durand-Charre 1990).

#### 4.3.2.5 Diffusion couples. 

These methods have become increasingly popular with the general, increased use of EPMA. The technique relies on the ability to quantitatively determine the diffusion paths as two samples of different metals are joined together and allowed to react at high temperatures. Essentially the method is non-equilibrium in that equilibrium would only be reached when complete homogenisation of diffusion couple took place. However, during the diffusion process the diffusion path follows equilibrium tie-lines within the various two-phase fields of a binary or ternary alloy because the alloy equalises the potential of the various components at the phase interface. Figure 4.13 shows such a path of a diffusion couple between alloys, A and B, in the Ni-Al-Fe system at 1000°C (Cheng and Dayanada 1979) and Fig. 4.14 shows the measured composition profiles of the various elements in a diffusion couple from Al-Nb-Ti at 1200°C (Hellwig 1990). In the latter case the diffusion path crosses three two-phase fields, (Nb, Ti)Al\\(\_{3}\\) + TiAl, TiAl + Nb\\(\_{2}\\)Al, and \\(\beta{}\\) + Nb\\(\_{2}\\)Al. Other good examples of this technique in practice can be found in the work of van Loo and co-workers (1978, 1980, 1981).
