Chapter 8
The Role of Magnetic Gibbs Energy

8.1, INTRODUCTION

In paramagnetic materials there is no polarisation of electron spins and therefore it
is unnecessary to consider a magnetic contribution to the Gibbs energy if this
condition is taken to be the standard state. However in ferromagnetic, anti-
ferromagnetic and ferri-magnetic materials, there is also competition between
different spin arrangements and the enthalpy of certain transition metals, rare earths
and their associated alloys and compounds are lowered by specific forms of spin
polarisation. This includes the technologically important elements Fe, Ni and Co
and their alloys and the effect can be of sufficient magnitude to have a major effect
on phase transformation.

There are many different forms of spin polarisation. The ferromagnetism exhibited
by b.c.c. Fe is probably the best-known variant. Here the coupling between atoms
favours parallel spin configurations between nearest neighbours and the critical
ordering temperature is known as the Curie temperature (7). In other materials the
exchange forces favour anti-parallel spins between nearest neighbours. If there is
only one species of atoms this is known as anti-ferromagnetism and the critical
ordering temperature is known as the Neel temperature (T,,). If the anti-parallel
coupling involves more than one species of atoms with different values of spin,
there will be a net spin in one particular direction. Such a material, e.g., Fe304, is
considered to be ferri-magnetic and again behaves like a ferromagnetic with a
Curie temperature.

Many other subtle differences can occur, such as periodic changes in the
crystallographic direction in which the spins are orientated, but these details are
rarely considered in thermodynamic terms. In the treatments which follow, it is
sufficient to note that the quantum number s = +'4 or — defines the spin-up or
spin-down direction for individual electrons, while the magnitude of any magnetic
effects depends on the number of electrons that are being polarised. The unit
magnetic moment associated with spin “4 is equal to a Bohr magneton (zg) and the
number of magnetic electrons/atom is defined by the symbol {, so that @ = 2s
(Bozorth 1956).

Unlike chemical ordering, which can only occur in alloys, magnetic ordering can
occur in unary systems and the magnetic Gibbs energy turns out to be sufficiently
large to cause fundamental changes in structure. For example, the high-temperature

form of solid Fe is 6 which has a b.c.c. structure and transforms to 7-Fe with the
more close-packed f.c.c. structure at 1394°C. Both of these phases are para-
magnetic at these elevated temperatures, but the onset of ferromagnetism in the
b.c.c. phase causes this phase to reappear at 912°C as a-Fe. This makes Fe a unique
element in that the high-temperature allotrope reappears at low temperatures, and it
should be noted that the thermodynamic effect due to short-range magnetic order is
already sufficient to cause the re-appearance of the b.c.c. form; a-Fe only becomes
ferromagnetic below its Curie temperature at 770°C. At 0 K the magnetic enthalpy
(%9000 J mol?) is an order of magnitude larger than was involved in the 6—~ high
temperature transformation (900 J mol).

The change in Gibbs energy with temperature of Fe, with respect to the para-
magnetic form 6-Fe, is shown in Fig. 8.1(a). This can be correlated directly with the
value of the magnetic specific heat (Fig. 8.1(b)) (Nishizawa et al.. 1979), which in
turn is related to a corresponding change in the saturation magnetisation, 3, (Fig.
8.1(c)) (Nishizawa 1978). The critical magnetic ordering temperature, the Curie
temperature (T.), is defined either by the peak in C7* or by the maximum rate of
change in the variation of 8 with T. The situation is made more complex on
alloying as both T, and (3 vary with composition.

It has already been mentioned in the previous chapter that the Ising model, which
underlies the formalism used for most chemical ordering treatments, was originally
used to describe magnetic transitions. It is, however, technically only valid if the
various magnetic states correspond to multiples of the unit magnetic spin, s. Early
attempts to describe the associated thermodynamic functions within formal
ordering theory were by Saito et al. (1959), Arita (1978) and Moran-Lopez and
Falicov (1979). More recent examples of the combination of chemical and
magnetic ordering, as applied to b.c.c. Fe-base alloys, have been given by Inden
and Pitsch (1991) and Kosakai and Miyazaki (1994). The BWG treatment appears
to be a reasonable assumption in such systems because the saturation magnetisation
of Fe (2.2 1g) is close to the integral value @ = 2 which is equivalent to s = 1.
However, the concentration dependence of the saturation magnetisation, and the
important role played by magnetic short-range order, makes it difficult to use such a
treatment in the general case and it has been necessary to devise alternative
methodologies to describe the magnetic Gibbs energy of alloy systems.

8.1.1 Polynomial representation of magnetic Gibbs energy

While acknowledging that the ‘Gibbs energy anomaly’ was associated with
magnetism, early attempts to characterise the behaviour of Fe, did not derive G™™*
explicitly from ferromagnetic parameters such as @. Instead, G™® was derived
either by the direct graphical integration of C7** or simply incorporated into the
overall Gibbs energy difference between the y- and a-phases in Fe by means of a
global polynomial expression such as used by Kaufman and Nesor (1973)

Different temperature regions then required different sets of coefficients and, in
specific systems, the coefficients had to be modified when used to describe the low-
temperature martensitic transformation (Kaufman and Cohen 1956). It soon became
evident that it was preferable to work with functions that properly reflected the
physical origin of the extra Gibbs energy. This was also important when moving
from pure Fe to increasingly complex steels, as specific heat measurements are not
often as generally available as measurements of @ or T..

8.1.2 Consideration of the best reference state

The first step is to consider the methods which can be used to represent the change
of magnetisation with temperature, and how this can be translated into the
corresponding change of G™*. By analogy with configurational ordering, it would
be reasonable to choose the ground state at 0 K as the fundamental reference point.
This view was taken by Zener (1955) who may be considered the first author to try
and obtain an explicit description of G™*. However, many important phase
changes are associated with the high-temperature behaviour, especially the region
where short-range magnetic order is present. Starting at 0 K therefore presents
certain problems. Firstly, an accurate representation of the temperature dependence
of the magnetic parameters is required, and this can be highly non-linear. Secondly,
anomalies can arise if there is a rapid variation of the magnetic ordering
temperature with composition (Inden 1991). This is particularly true if T, reaches
zero in the middle of a system. Finally, it is necessary to devise a system which can
take care of mixtures of magnetic and non-magnetic components.

In contrast to most treatments of configurational ordering, the high-temperature
paramagnetic state has therefore been adopted as the best reference state. Objec-
tions to using this state on the grounds that it cannot be retained below T, are
unwarranted, as the situation can be considered analogous to using the liquid phase
as a reference state at high temperatures.

8.1.3 Magnitude of the short-range magnetic order component

The magnetic specific heat shows a marked degree of short-range magnetic order
above T, which decreases asymptotically to zero when T' >> T,. Figure 8.2 illus-
trates how the equivalent values for Ni are obtained by careful subtraction of other
components from the total specific heat (Hofmann et al. 1956). The importance of
standardising this procedure has been emphasised by de Fontaine et al. (1995), The
fraction (¢) of the total magnetic enthalpy retained above T, is clearly always an
important quantity and, by analysing experimental results, Inden (1976) obtained a

value of ¢ = 0.27 for both f.c.c. Ni and Co while the larger value of ¢ = 0.43 was
found for b.c.c. Fe. These values were subsequently assumed equally valid for all
other f.c.c. and b.c.c. phases (Hillert and Jarl 1978, Inden 1981a). While this is a
reasonable assumption for steels, it may not hold for atoms with larger magnetic
moments (de Fontaine et al. 1995). This has been confirmed by a CVM treatment
applied to Gd (Schon and Inden 1996). In order to incorporate this result into a
semi-empirical treatment suitable for multi-component systems it may be
worthwhile to revert to an earlier suggestion (Paskin 1957) that ¢ is a function
of s and the nearest-neighbour co-ordination number, (z),
stl
o= s(z—1)° (6.2)

 

8.2. DERIVATION OF THE MAGNETIC ENTROPY

While it is important to partition the long-range and short-range magnetic com-
ponents correctly, the maximum entropy contribution due to magnetism, Sms, is
an equally crucial factor.

8.2.1 Theoretical value for the maximum magnetic entropy
Despite the intrinsic complexity of magnetic phenomena, there is general agreement

===========
234 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik

that the maximum entropy generated by the de-coupling of spins between atoms
can be expressed by:

Smee = Rlog,(2s + 1). (8.3)

Technically, the values of s are theoretically restricted to integral multiples of s and
one should consider the sum of each contributing species, but these values are not
always available.

8.2.2 Empirical value for the maximum magnetic entropy

The saturation magnetisation @, in 4g per atom, of many materials often corres-
ponds to non-integral values of s. This is due to contributions other than s being
involved, for example polarised conduction electrons. It is, therefore, general
practice to substitute the experimental value of the saturation magnetisation at 0 K,
Bp, for 2s in Eq. (8.3) which leads to (Miodownik 1977)

Smeg = Rlog.(fo + 1). (8.4)
8.2.3 Explicit variation in entropy with magnetic spin number and temperature
The magnetic entropy may be rigorously specified if the BWG mean-field approxi-
mation is combined with specific values of the magnetic spin. The expression for
the magnetic entropy corresponding to s = 4, as a function of the degree of order

n, is identical to that already given in Eq. (7.2) of the previous chapter on
configurational ordering

Sis = -wha| (52) toge(*£2) + (252) toe C3). (85)

However, the permutation of permissible spins rapidly becomes more complicated
with higher values of s. The equivalent expression for s=1, as derived by
Semenovskaya (1974) and used by Inden (1975, 1981), is given by

SEakE™! = — Nkp[log,(8 ~ 69 + 2/4 — 377) — (1 ~ n)log,(2(1 — n))
- (1+ n)bog.(n + Va=37)]. (86)
Expressions corresponding to s = 3.2 and s = 2 are listed in Inden (1981).

8.3. DERIVATION OF MAGNETIC ENTHALPY, H™A¢

8.3.1 Classical derivation
The simplest case is to start with a situation where all the atoms have the same spin.

The general expression for the BWG (mean field) approximation then gives
N
HT = — (k) 76k) 72 52 .
2 » 2) JB 7? 5 (8.7)

This allows for a summation for magnetic interactions in successive (k-th) neigh-
bouring shells but, unless J values can be derived from first-principles calculations,
there is generally insufficient experimental data to allow anything other than a
single nearest-neighbour interaction parameter to be used. This, then, must be taken
to incorporate any other longer-range effects, and application to real alloy systems
is also technically restricted by having to use multiples of s = 1/2. Much therefore
depends on whether this realistically simulates experimental values of 8, which
fortunately seem to be the case in Fe-rich, Co-rich and Ni-rich alloys. However, this
is less secure at higher solute concentrations, especially if there are transitions
between different forms of magnetism in the system (see Fig. 8.4).

An equation which includes the effect of adding a magnetic term to the enthalpy
of an ordered system has already been given in Section 7.3.2.3 of Chapter 7, but no
details were given of how to determine the value of the magnetic interaction energy
MY). For a binary alloy A,_,B, this involves the introduction of three magnetic
interaction parameters J, we, and J which describe the strength of the coup-
ling between nearest-neighbour atoms whose (magnetic) electrons have parallel
spins as compared to anti-parallel spins. The magnetic interchange energy M) is
then obtained by combining these parameters to yield

ME) = JO) 4 30) — as). (8.8)

This is entirely analogous to the treatment of the chemical interaction energies V;;
treated in Chapter 7. Negative values of Jj,; correspond to ferromagnetism while
positive values correspond to anti-ferromagnetism. Positive values of Mj; imply
that the strength of the ferro-magnetic coupling between unlike atoms is stronger
than between like atoms. Most treatments do not consider magnetic interactions
beyond the nearest-neighbour coordination shell.

The most convenient way of determining the interchange energies is from
experimental values of the critical ordering temperature, which is designated the
Curie temperature for ferromagnetic ordering The Curie temperature for alloys with
two magnetic components having the same spin (1/2 or 1) can be written as
follows:

T= pTBwe =
i (1) (1) Mo Me)

In this equation, 2 is the magnetic analogue to the x factor used in the chemical
ordering case to compensate for the higher critical temperatures always generated
by the BWG formalism (see Chapter 7). Comparing the results from the BWG
treatment with those of other more sophisticated treatments leads to a value of
ps = 0.8 (Inden 1975) and the long-range ordering parameter 77 takes values between
0 and 1 as in the case of chemical ordering. In the magnetic case 7 equals the ratio
of the mean spin value per atom at temperature T to the maximum value of s (at
0 K). K, is a parameter which varies with the magnitude of the magnetic spin s
such that K, = 1 for s = 1/2 and K, = 2/3 for s = 1. The coefficients a and ( can
be set either to 0 or | to cover various combinations of magnetic and non-magnetic
components.

8.3.2 Empirical derivation

Given that S™% can be described using Eq. (8.4), it may be asked whether a
corresponding value for Hmé can be obtained by combining S73 with T.. If
magnetic ordering was a first-order transformation with a critical temperature, T*,
it would then follow that (Fig. 8.3).

HB = TST, (8.10)

However, since magnetic ordering is a second-order transformation, this has to be

modified to take into account the proportion of short- and long-range order on
either side of T, (see Section 8.1.3). Miodownik (1977) assumed that T* = 0.97,
for Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. It then follows that

H™€ = 0.9T, log.(fo + 1). (8.11)
Weiss and Tauer (1958) made the alternative assumption that
HE’ = RTs. (8.12)

Such equations have the advantage of simplicity but comparison with Eq. (8.2)
implies that ¢ is totally independent of s and z. Whichever expression is used, the
next step is to incorporate the effect of temperature on the alignment of the
magnetic spins. In view of the other simplifications which have already been
adopted, this can be achieved (Miodownik 1977, 1978) by approximating the
Brillouin-Langevin formalism for the number of aligned spins (87) remaining at
T < 0.97, through the following expression:

BT = Bll -7] (8.13)

where r defines the ratio (7'/T,). Assuming that the magnetic enthalpy scales as
(87 /Bo) this can then be combined with an arbitrary power function to account for
short-range magnetic order for T' > 0.9T,)

BT = ro(1/2)™e-), (8.14)

Equation (8.14) leads to a value for ¢ = 0.25 at T,, which is of comparable mag-
nitude to the values assumed by Inden (1981a), although it clearly does not include
any dependence on the co-ordination number z.

8.4. DERIVATION OF MAGNETIC GIBBS ENERGY

Even if magnetic interaction energies are available to define a magnetic enthalpy,
the development of a viable Gibbs energy expression is difficult. As already noted
in the preceding section, the expressions for the magnetic entropy in a BWG treat-
ment become increasingly complicated when s > 1/2 and, indeed, may become
inexact if the distribution of individual spins is not known. In practice their application
also requires a series of nested Gibbs energy minimisation calculations which
become costly in computing time. Also, of course, the BWG approximation does
not take into account any short-range order except through empirical corrections.

Despite these drawbacks remarkably good results have been obtained in the equi-
atomic region of the Fe-Co system (Inden 1977) which are virtually indistinguish-
able from those obtained by CVM calculations (Colinet 1993). However, this

region deals only with A2/B2 equilibria where the BWG method is known to work
well. It is otherwise inadequate to deal with f.c.c.—b.c.c. equilibria, notably in pure
Fe or Fe-rich alloys, because of the very small differences in the free energies of the
f.c.c. and b.c.c. allotropes. In such cases it is vitally important to include short-range
magnetic order and find alternative means of defining the magnetic Gibbs energy.

8.4.1 General algorithms for the magnetic Gibbs energy

With expressions for the magnetic enthalpy and entropy it is now possible to build
up an algorithm for G™* at any temperature. The maximum magnetic entropy is
taken as

Saf = Suzy ~ StE0- (8.15)
In an analogous way the maximum magnetic enthalpy is
Het = Hie — Hip (8.16)

The magnetic entropy and enthalpy at a given temperature, Sp and Hr"*, respec-
tively, are

Sp’, Hr"* = f(T, Te, B) (8.17)
while the magnetic Gibbs energy G7 at a given temperature is given by
Gr = Gre — GP™, (8.18)

8.4.2 Magnetic Gibbs energy as a direct function of 3 and T,
Combining the expressions for magnetic entropy and enthalpy and assuming that
the magnetic enthalpy scales as 67 /fy

GF = -0.9RT- log.(Bo + 1)(B"/Bo) — RT log.(o- A" +1). (8.19)

Here the first term represents Hy and the second term the effect of S7”*.
Eq. (8.19) represents one of the many empirical ways in which Eq. (8.18) can be
made to work in practice (Miodownik 1977). However, this expression does not
lend itself easily to a derivation of the associated value of C, nor to an explicit
formulation of 5AG™€/éT. Therefore, most alternative expressions have been
based on approximate analytical expressions for the magnetic specific heat.
However, all such expressions also incorporate the functions log,(@ + 1) and 7 and
are a far cry from the original methods of graphical integration.

8.4.3 Magnetic Gibbs energy as a function of CT for ferromagnetic systems

8.4.3.1 The model of Inden. This approach was pioneered by Inden (1976) who
developed the following empirical equations:

 

References are listed on pp. 256-258.

===========
CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 239
fort <1 cmt = K'?Rlog,(1 +7°)/log.(1 — 7°) (8.20a)
for7 >1 cm® = K*?Rlog,(1 +7°)/log.(1 ~ 7°) (8.20b)

where K'? and K*"° are empirically derived coefficients. At first sight these
equations appear to differ substantially from Eq. (8.19), but the values of K' tro and
K*° are constrained by the need to correctly reproduce both the total entropy and
take into account experimental values of ¢. Since the total entropy is an explicit
function of {, the net result is that this treatment also has a mixed dependence on
the two key magnetic parameters 6 and T,. Further, a relationship between K"?
and K"' can be obtained by considering Hieg:

K* = 518/675(K" + 0.6K”) = log,(3 + 1) (8.21)
K'° = 474/497((1 — ¢)/4]K". (8.22)

A dependence on crystallographic parameters is introduced through making ¢ a
function of z, as already indicated in Section 8.1.3. Introducing fixed values of ¢
appropriate to each crystal structure is a useful simplification as it is then possible
to uniquely define the values of K"° and K*° (de Fontaine et al. 1995).

8.4.3.2 Model of Hillert and Jarl. In his original treatment, Inden (1976) used a
complicated but closed expression for the enthalpy, but had to use a series
expansion in order to calculate the entropy. Hillert and Jarl (1978) therefore
decided to convert the C, expression directly through a series expansion which
substantially simplifies the overall calculation and leads to a maximum error of
only 1-2 J/mol at the Curie temperature of Fe. The equivalent equations to those
used by Inden (1976) are given by

forr <1 cms = 2K R(r™ 447m 4 1 sm) (8.23a)
forr>1 CR = DKR(r +37 4 By), (8.23b)
8.4.3.3 Alternative C, models. Chuang et al. (1985) have developed alternative
exponential functions to describe the C, curves and applied this to various Fe-base
alloys (Chuang et al. 1986)

fort <1 C, = K'Rrexp(—p(1 — r)) (8.24a)
fort >1 C, = K" Rr exp(—q(1 — 1). (8.24b)

These equations have the advantage of greater mathematical simplicity, but it is
still necessary to evaluate the constants K’, K”, p and q.

8.4.3.4 Comparison of models for the ferromagnetic Gibbs energy. It is difficult to
compare the various treatments described in Sections 8.4.3.1 to 8.4.3.3, because
simultaneous changes were made in both the models and input parameters during
their formulation. This is a perennial problem if different weightings are attached to
magnetic and thermodynamic data (de Fontaine et al. 1995). The suggestion by
Inden (1976) that values for m and n in Eqs (18.18a) and (18.18b) should be taken
as 3 and 5 respectively has been preserved by Hillert and Jarl (1978). This is still
the core assumption as far as 3d elements are concerned in current models.
However, it may be necessary to relax this assumption in systems with larger
magnetic spin numbers (de Fontaine et al. 1995)

8.4.4 Anti-ferromagnetic and ferri-magnetic systems

Providing there is no change in value of J with temperature, Eq. (8.4) can also be
used to determine the maximum magnetic entropy in anti-ferromagnetic and ferri-
magnetic materials (Miodownik 1978a, Smith 1967, Hofmann et al. 1956). A
comparison of predicted and experimental magnetic entropies and energies (Table
8.1) indicates that this is a reasonable assumption in most cases. If serious
discrepancies remain between theoretical expectations and experimental results, it
may be necessary to consider the existence of multiple magnetic states (see
Section 8.7).

8.5. THE EFFECT OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS
The treatment of compounds and other end-members of fixed composition does not

differ from that of the elements, but the next vital step is to consider the
representation of these parameters for solid solutions.

8.5.1 Effect of changes in T, and B with composition

The earliest derivation of G7"® was made by Zener (1955) who postulated that the
effect of an alloying element was proportional to its effect on T,. With the
assumption that 6Tc/6z is a constant, it is then possible to write:

GU (T) = GRE(T) - “(= spot (8.25)

where T = T, — 2(6T/5z). The Zener method therefore depends totally on the
assumption of a linear variation of 57,/6x and any associated changes in § are
reflected in the change of T,. It can, nevertheless, give reasonable results for dilute
solutions and was extensively used by Hillert et al. (1967) in the period before the
Inden formulation was more generally adopted in Europe. It, however, remained
popular in Japan for the characterisation of Fe alloys, which was its original field of
application (Nishizawa et al. 1979, Hasebe et al. 1985).

Zener’s method does not explicitly take into account the effect of changes in 8
with composition but implicitly assumes that any changes in f are reflected in the
changes in T,. Clougherty and Kaufman (1963) considered how changes in ( with
composition might affect the terminal magnetic entropy of f.c.c. Ni-Zn alloys, but
this did not lead to a generalised approach which was applicable across the whole
system. Miodownik (1977) showed that values of T, and @ for alloys could be intro-
duced into the same algorithm developed for the elements, but this was superseded
by the advent of the Hillert~Jarl formalism. With the need to handle multi-component
calculations it was then a natural step to develop (separate) Redlich-Kister
polynomials for the variation of 8 and T, with composition (Chin et al. 1987).

8.5.2 Systems whose end-members exhibit different forms of magnetism

8.5.2.1 Ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition. When end-members
exhibit different forms of magnetism there are often significant deviations from
linearity in both T, and ( and these parameters may become zero in the middle of
the system. One example is associated with a change from ferromagnetic to anti-
ferromagnetic behaviour which occurs in a number of industrially important
systems, such as Fe-Ni (Fig. 8.4(a)) and the related ternary system Fe-Ni-Mn
(Fig. 8.4(b)). b.c.c. Fe-Cr, rare-earth and oxide systems can also exhibit similar
complexity. In such situations special measures need to be taken to allow a
Redlich-Kister-type polynomial to be used to describe J, and f. Since
ferromagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism are associated with values for Jj; of
opposite sign, Weiss and Tauer (1956) suggested that a continuous change between
these two forms of magnetic ordering could best be described by attaching a
negative sign to Neel temperatures. These authors also suggested a semi-empirical

relation between Ti, and 3 which is useful if one or other of these parameters is
not experimentally available.

Tere = 113.5(Zt -Z1) In (6 +1). (8.26)

Here the two parameters, ZT and Z|, refer to the relative number of spins of
opposite sign, which allows this equation to be used for both ferromagnetic and
anti-ferromagnetic materials. One implication of Eq. (8.26) is that, for a given value
of @ and type of magnetism, the critical temperature is expected to be higher for
f.c.c, materials than for b.c.c. materials, which accounts for the observation that
T° > TF although B© < AF*. There are, however, problems when applying this
simple empirical equation to anti-ferromagnetic BCC materials such as Cr and to
structures with lower symmetry.

A more important conclusion of Eq. (8.26) is that, for a given value of @ in an
f.c.c. lattice, the value of T,, derived for an anti-ferromagnetic alloy will be 1/3 of
the equivalent value of T, in the ferromagnetic case. The utility of this approach has
been verified by Chin et al. (1987) who, in order to optimise parameters for their
Redlich-Kister polynomials for the critical temperatures of various binary alloy
systems, converted positive values of T,, to negative values of T, and were able to
reproduce the critical temperature variation arising from the ferromagnetic/anti-
ferromagnetic transition. These authors also used the same convention to differentiate
ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic values of § when adapting the Hillert-Jarl
formalism into Thermo-Calc, although this must be considered purely as a
mathematical convenience and has no theoretical justification.

Another simplification that has been made with respect to the implementation of
magnetic algorithms into software packages, such as Thermo-Calc, relates to the
composition at which T, and ( reach zero. One might expect that this would happen
at one particular composition but Figs. 8.4(a) and (b) show that the situation may be
much more complicated. In order to be consistent with a simplified magnetic model
Chin et al. (1987) chose a set of parameters which effectively smoothed out the
differences in the two critical compositions for binary alloys. This however pre-
cludes a proper prediction of regions of mixed magnetism, which is important in
Invar alloys (Miodownik 1978b) as well as making it impossible to reproduce
effects such as shown in Figs. 8.4(a) and (b).

8.5.2.2 Ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In other cases, a zero T, may be
associated with the transition between ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. Even
the use of higher-order Redlich—Kister polynomials cannot properly reproduce such
a sudden change in slope and some smoothing of the measured variation of T, and
B has to be accepted in the vicinity of 0 K. As both enthalpy and entropy contribu-
tions scale approximately with T,, at low temperatures, this will only lead to small
errors on the overall Gibbs energy at such compositions. However, under certain
circumstances spurious miscibility gaps have been predicted at high temperatures

in systems that exhibit abrupt changes in T, with composition (Inden 1981). Care
has, therefore, to be taken in deriving the input parameters to the Hillert—Jarl
formalism in such cases. The fact remains that such miscibility gaps have never
been observed in practice and it may, therefore, be that as T, approaches zero some
other effects, such as itinerant ferromagnetism (Wohlfarth 1974), may occur which
essentially smooth out the variation of magnetic entropy. In this instance, the
Redlich—-Kister formalism may actually be a better approximation to reality than
would be indicated by trying to reproduce a T, or T, obtained by linear extrap-
olation of experimental results to 0 K.

8.6. THE ESTIMATION OF MAGNETIC PARAMETERS

8.6.1 Magnetic versus thermochemical approaches to evaluating the magnetic
Gibbs energy

In principle, the value of Gr should be the same whether it is derived from
knowledge of ( or from the magnetic specific heat. Since the latter is derived by
subtraction of other major terms from the total specific heat, such an agreement is a
useful confirmation that the deconvolution process has been properly conducted.
However, this is not always achieved. In some studies, e.g., for Cr (Andersson
1985), Co (Fernandez-Guillermet 1987) and Ni (Dinsdale 1991), the listed 6 values
are ‘effective thermochemical moments’ which have been derived on the basis of a
global thermochemical assessment rather than from magnetic measurements. Small
differences will always arise when considering ways of averaging data and
truncating series, but one should be cautious of a tendency for f to become an
adjustable parameter. Such discrepancies will hopefully be reduced in the future by
the incorporation of better magnetic models (de Fontaine et al. 1995).

8.6.2 Values of the saturation magnetisation, B

It should be emphasised that it is the rule rather than the exception for to change
markedly with crystal structure (Table 8.2). It is therefore unwise to assume that
various metastable allotropes can be given the same value of 6 as for the stable
structure. In some cases values of @ can be extrapolated from stable or metastable
alloys with the requisite crystal structure, but in others this is not possible. A
significant development is that it is now possible to include spin polarisation in
electron energy calculations (Moruzzi and Marcus 1988, 1990a,b, Asada and
Terakura 1995). This allows a calculation of the equilibrium value of to be made
in any desired crystal structure. More importantly, such values are in good accord
with known values for equilibrium phases (Table 8.2). It has also been shown that
magnetic orbital contributions play a relatively minor role (Eriksson et al. 1990), so
calculated values of 9 for metastable phases should be reasonably reliable.

specific heat (Lytton 1964, Meschter et al. 1981, Chuang et al. 1985). Some of
these differences can be rationalised by the occurrence of mixed magnetic states
resulting from increasing temperatures, as most of the data in Table 8.2 essentially
refers to 0 K. This is almost certainly the case for Cr and Mn (Weiss 1972, 1979,
Moruzzi and Marcus 1990a, b). In the case of Co, the c.p.h. form, é-Co, is a close
competitor to the f.c.c. form, a-Co, near the Curie temperature. High stacking-fault
densities may therefore also lead to unusual effects (Miodownik 1977). In the case
of a-Mn, there is documented evidence for a considerable decrease in 9 on passing
through T;, which could be associated with a transition from an anti-ferromagnetic
to a ‘non-magnetic state’ (Gazzara et al. 1964, Weiss 1979). Nevertheless, a single
temperature-independent value of @ seems a useful starting point in the majority of
cases, especially when no other data is available to predict values for metastable
elements and solutions. It is noted that @ is very sensitive to atomic volume
(Moruzzi and Marcus 1990a,b) which is certainly one of the reasons for the non-
linearity observed for the variation of @ even in simple solid solutions.

8.7. MULTIPLE MAGNETIC STATES,

It is not generally appreciated that there are many competing forms of magnetic
ordering. When one particular magnetic ground state is substantially more stable
than other alternatives, the conventional disordering of magnetic spins, as described
in the previous sections, is the only scenario which needs to be considered.
However, additional excitations at high temperatures can arise if another magnetic
configuration with a comparable ground-state energy exists. Such a hypothesis was
used to explain a number of anomalous experimental results in the case of
metastable phases in various Fe, Ni and Co alloys and particularly in the case of
Invar alloys (Weiss 1963, Chikazumi and Matsui 1978). Together with the switch
from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic behaviour (Fig. 8.4) this makes com-
pelling experimental evidence for the co-existence of two magnetic states in Fe-Ni
and Fe-Co alloys (Miodownik 1978b). Weiss (1979) later extended this concept to
other 3d elements.

8.7.1 Treatments of multiple states
The simplest way to describe the equilibrium between various competing states is
to use a Shottky model (Weiss 1963) where

a= = 2 exp (—AE/RT). (8.27)
fn on

Here a is the ratio of the fraction of atoms, f, corresponding to the two magnetic

states, y, and -y2, and g; and g» are the corresponding degeneracies of the two
states. Clearly if AF (the difference in energy between the two states) is large
and/or the temperature is low, there is effectively only one state and one magnetic
moment. However, as AE becomes smaller there can be changes in the effective
magnetic moment, especially in the case of 7-Fe. Here the two states correspond to
a ferromagnetic moment of ~ 2.8jB and an anti-ferromagnetic moment of
= 0.5 uB, which leads to the effective moment being given by

BR* = [2.8/(1 +a) + 0.5a/(1 +0). (8.28)

This contrasts with the assumption made in virtually all other magnetic models that
the value of is independent of temperature. Several variants of the Shottky model
have been developed by Miodownik (1977, 1978a) to take into account the situa-
tion where one of the two states subsequently undergoes magnetic ordering (Fig.
8.5). In such cases it may also be necessary to consider a temperature-dependent
AE (Miodownik and Hillert 1980).

8.7.2 Thermodynamic consequences of multiple states

One of the consequences of accepting the presence of multiple magnetic states is an
additional contribution to the entropy and, therefore, several authors have con-
sidered the inclusion of multiple states in their description of low-temperature phase
transformations in Fe and its alloys (Kaufman et al. 1963, Miodownik 1970,
Bendick and Pepperhoff 1978). However, most authors have, in the end, preferred
to describe the magnetic effects in Fe using more conventional temperature-
independent values for the magnetic moments of the relevant phases. This is partly
linked to the absence of any provision for the necessary formalism in current

software packages for phase-diagram calculations, and also to the fact that, with the
exception of Roy and Pettifor (1977), there was little theoretical backing for the
concept of multiple states in its early stages of development.

It is interesting to note that recent electron energy calculations (Moroni and
Jarlsberg 1990, Moruzzi and Marcus 1990a,b, Asada and Terakura 1995) have not
only confirmed the necessary energetics for the existence of multiple states, but
have also confirmed both the values of the moments (Table 8.2) and the energy
gaps which had been previously inferred from experimental evidence (Fig. 8.6). It
has therefore been suggested (de Fontaine et al. 1995) that future developments
should make provision for the inclusion of multiple states. While having only a
marginal effect on AG at high temperatures (Fig. 8.7a) such a model would lead to
significant changes in the driving force for low-temperature (martensitic) transfor-
mations and, more importantly, should lead to better modelling of many associated
changes in physical properties (Bendick and Pepperhoff 1978, Bendick et al. 1977).

observed in various systems and confirmed by Gibbs energy calculations
(Miodownik 1982).

A marked change in solid solubility. This occurs at the point where the solubility
limit is intersected by the locus of magnetic transformation temperatures (Fig. 8.8).
The magnitude of such effects obviously scales with the value of G™£/dT and are
most marked in Fe- and Co-rich alloys (Nishizawa et al. 1979, Hasebe et al. 1985).
An interesting recent example is given by the Fe-Co—Zn system as the latter two
elements have opposite effects on the Curie temperature of Fe (Takayama et al.
1995). In some early diagrams, such abrupt changes were inexplicable and deemed
to be due to ‘experimental error’.

Distortion of miscibility gaps. In the case of some miscibility gaps such inter-
sections are accompanied by an even more marked distortion (Fig. 8.9). This is now
often called the Nishizawa Horn, due to the extensive work of Nishizawa and co-
workers (1979, 1992) on this effect, but it is interesting to note that the effect had
previously been noted by Meijering (1963). Here, too, the apparent presence of
more than one maximum in a miscibility gap was believed to represent experi-
mental error before it was shown to have a sound theoretical foundation.

Continuous transition between first- and second-order transformations. When
examined more closely, the Nishizawa Hom represents a situation where there is a
continuous transition between a first- and second-order transformation. This
remarkable situation is not restricted to systems which exhibit a miscibility gap
(Inden 1981a) (Fig. 8.10), and it therefore remains to be seen whether it is possible
to maintain a hard and fast distinction between these two types of transformation

effect on the topography of the a/ region in Fe-base alloys. Because of the
location of the Curie temperature in pure Fe, the effect of magnetic forces on the
A3 is much more pronounced than on the A4 and alloying additions can produce
asymmetric effects on the two transitions (Zener 1955, Miodownik 1977, 1978a, b).
Interestingly, although the Curie temperature of Co is much higher, the value of
Gigg-eP is not as affected because the magnetic properties of both phases are
similar (Miodownik 1977). However, because S'°*-¢P> js also small, the
allotropic transition temperature can be substantially reduced (Fig. 8.11).
Magnetic effects on metastable transformations, The underlying factor in all the
above effects is the magnitude of the ratio (G™8/G'*) and especially its
variation with temperature. It follows that there can also be a substantial effect on
the driving force for phase transformations, including shear transformations. Thus

structures, this will also be affected by any magnetic component in either or both
these structures (Fig. 8.11). This has been analysed by both Ishida (1975) and
Miodownik (1978c). Although some of the parameters in both papers need to be re-
examined in the light of more recent data, it is difficult to account for the observed
trends without taking the magnetic Gibbs energy into consideration.

8.9. INTERACTION WITH EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELDS

All the effects noted above can be considered to arise from an internal magnetic
field. But a Gibbs energy contribution, G7", is also generated if two phases
differing in saturation magnetisation by an amount, AJ, are placed in an external
magnetic field, H, and is given by

This term is entirely analogous to the more commonly recognised product PAV
and is yet another constituent of the expression for the total Gibbs energy. The
effect has been confirmed by many experiments and an external magnetic field can
destabilise austenite during martensitic transformations, causing a rise in Ms
temperature of approximately 3°K Tesla“! (Sadovskiy et al. 1961, Fields and
Graham 1976). This effect turns out to be directly proportional to the difference in
entropy between the two phases (Satyanarayan ef al. 1972). A magnetic field can
also markedly alter the rate of transformation in isothermal martensite reactions
(Peters et al, 1972, Kakeshita et al. 1993). While changes in Mg due to deformation
are well known, the presence of high magnetic fields generated by superconductors
at cryogenic temperatures can produce similar effects. Diffusion-controlled
transformations are also prone to magnetic-field effects as the driving force for
transformation is affected. Thus Fe—-Co alloys can be converted from 100%
austenite to 100% ferrite at elevated temperatures (Fig. 8.13) under the influence of
a field generated by a conventional bench magnet (Peters and Miodownik 1973).
The expansion of a miscibility gap and the precipitation of the o phase in Fe~Cr
alloys (Chen et al. 1983) are another example of effects that can be induced by an
extemal field.

Although a magnetic field is not commonly applied, it has certain advantages in
allowing a precise increment of Gibbs energy to be added instantaneously to a
