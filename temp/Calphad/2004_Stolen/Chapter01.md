# Thermodynamic foundations

## Basic concepts

### Thermodynamic systems

A thermodynamic description of a process needs a well-defined system. A thermodynamic system contains everything of thermodynamic interest for a particular chemical process within a boundary. The boundary is either a real or hypothetical enclosure or surface that confines the system and separates it from its surroundings. In order to describe the thermodynamic behavior of a physical system, the interaction between the system and its surroundings must be understood. Thermodynamic systems are thus classified into three main types according to the way they interact with the surroundings: isolated systems do not exchange energy or matter with their surroundings; closed systems exchange energy with the surroundings but not matter; and open systems exchange both energy and matter with their surroundings. 

#boundary, #surroundings, #system/isolated, #system/closed, #system/open 

The system may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. An exact definition is difficult, but it is convenient to define a homogeneous system as one whose properties are the same in all parts, or at least their spatial variation is continuous. A heterogeneous system consists of two or more distinct homogeneous regions or phases, which are separated from one another by surfaces of discontinuity. The boundaries between phases are not strictly abrupt, but rather regions in which the properties change abruptly from the properties of one homogeneous phase to those of the other. For example, Portland cement consists of a mixture of the phases $\beta-Ca_2SiO_4$, $Ca_3SiO_5$, $Ca_3Al_2O_6$ and $Ca_4Al_2Fe_2O_10$. The different homogeneous phases are readily distinguished from each other macroscopically and the thermodynamics of the system can be treated based on the sum of the thermodynamics of each single homogeneous phase.

#system/homogeneous, #system/heterogeneous, #phases

In colloids, on the other hand, the different phases are not easily distinguished macroscopically due to the small particle size that characterizes these systems. So although a colloid also is a heterogeneous system, the effect of the surface thermodynamics must be taken into consideration in addition to the thermodynamics of each homogeneous phase. **In the following, when we speak about heterogeneous systems, it must be understood (if not stated otherwise) that the system is one in which each homogeneous phase is spatially sufficiently large to neglect surface energy contributions.** The contributions from surfaces become important in systems where the dimensions of the homogeneous regions are about $1\:\mu{}m$ or less in size. The thermodynamics of surfaces will be considered in Chapter 6.

#colloids

A homogeneous system - solid, liquid or gas - is called a solution if the composition of the system can be varied. The components of the solution are the substances of fixed composition that can be mixed in varying amounts to form the solution. The choice of the components is often arbitrary and depends on the purpose of the problem that is considered. The solid solution $LaCr_{1-y}Fe_yO_3$ can be treated as a quasi-binary system with $LaCrO_3$ and $LaFeO_3$ as components. Alternatively, the compound may be regarded as forming from $La_2O_3$, $Fe_2O_3$ and $Cr_2O_3$ or from the elements $La$, $Fe$, $Cr$ and $O_2(g)$. In $La_2O_3$ or $LaCrO_3$, for example, the elements are present in a definite ratio, and independent variation is not allowed. $La_2O_3$ can thus be treated as a single component system. We will come back to this important topic in discussing the Gibbs phase rule in [Chapter 4](Chapter04.md).

#solution

### Thermodynamic variables

In thermodynamics the state of a system is specified in terms of macroscopic state variables such as volume, $V$, temperature, $T$, pressure, $p$, and the number of moles of the chemical constituents $i$, $n_i$. The laws of thermodynamics are founded on the concepts of internal energy ($U$), and entropy ($S$), which are functions of the state variables. Thermodynamic variables are categorized as intensive or extensive. Variables that are proportional to the size of the system (*e.g.* volume and internal energy) are called extensive variables, whereas variables that specify a property that is independent of the size of the system (*e.g.* temperature and pressure) are called intensive variables.

#variablel/state, #state-functions, #variable/intensive, #variable/extensive

A state function is a property of a system that has a value that depends on the conditions (state) of the system and not on how the system has arrived at those conditions (the thermal history of the system). For example, the temperature in a room at a given time does not depend on whether the room was heated up to that temperature or cooled down to it. The difference in any state function is identical for every process that takes the system from the same given initial state to the same given final state: it is independent of the path or process connecting the two states. Whereas the internal energy of a system is a state function, work and heat are not. Work and heat are not associated with one given state of the system, but are defined only in a transformation of the system. Hence the work performed and the heat adsorbed by the system between the initial and final states depend on the choice of the transformation path linking these two states.

#energy/work, #energy/heat

### Thermodynamic processes and equilibrium

The state of a physical system evolves irreversibly towards a time-independent state in which we see no further macroscopic physical or chemical changes. This is the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, characterized for example by a uniform temperature throughout the system but also by other features. A non-equilibrium state can be defined as a state where irreversible processes drive the system towards the state of equilibrium. The rates at which the system is driven towards equilibrium range from extremely fast to extremely slow. In the latter case the isolated system may appear to have reached equilibrium. Such a system, which fulfills the characteristics of an equilibrium system but is not the true equilibrium state, is called a metastable state. Carbon in the form of diamond is stable for extremely long periods of time at ambient pressure and temperature, but transforms to the more stable form, graphite, if given energy sufficient to climb the activation energy barrier. Buckminsterfullerene, $C_{60}$, and the related $C_{70}$ and carbon nanotubes, are other metastable modifications of carbon. The enthalpies of
three modifications of carbon relative to graphite are given in Figure 1.1 (1, 2).

#equilibrium, #metastability, #irreversibility

Glasses are a particular type of material that is neither stable nor metastable. Glasses are usually prepared by rapid cooling of liquids. Below the melting point the liquid become supercooled and is therefore metastable with respect to the equilibrium crystalline solid state. At the glass transition the supercooled liquid transforms to a glass. The properties of the glass depend on the quenching rate (thermal history) and do not fulfill the requirements of an equilibrium phase. **Glasses represent non-ergodic states, which means that they are not able to explore their entire phase space, and glasses are thus not in internal equilibrium.** Both stable states (such as liquids above the melting temperature) and metastable states (such as supercooled liquids between the melting and glass transition temperatures) are in internal equilibrium and thus ergodic. Frozen-in degrees of freedom are frequently present, even in crystalline compounds. Glassy crystals exhibit translational periodicity of the molecular center of mass, whereas the molecular orientation is frozen either in completely random directions or randomly among a preferred set of orientations. **Strictly  spoken, only ergodic states can be treated in terms of classical thermodynamics.**

## The first law of thermodynamics

### Conservation of energy

The first law of thermodynamics may be expressed as: **Whenever any process occurs, the sum of all changes in energy, taken over all the systems participating in the process, is zero.**

The important consequence of the first law is that energy is always conserved. This law governs the transfer of energy from one place to another, in one form or another: as heat energy, mechanical energy, electrical energy, radiation energy, etc. The energy contained within a thermodynamic system is termed the internal energy or simply the energy of the system, $U$. In all processes, reversible or irreversible, the change in internal energy must be in accord with the first law of thermodynamics.

#energy/first-law, #energy/conservation, #energy/internal 

Work is done when an object is moved against an opposing force. It is equivalent to a change in height of a body in a gravimetric field. The energy of a system is its capacity to do work. When work is done on an otherwise isolated system, its capacity to do work is increased, and hence the energy of the system is increased. When the system does work its energy is reduced because it can do less work than before. When the energy of a system changes as a result of temperature differences between the system and its surroundings, the energy has been transferred as heat. Not all boundaries permit transfer of heat, even when there is a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. A boundary that does not allow heat transfer is called adiabatic. Processes that release energy as heat are called exothermic, whereas processes that absorb energy as heat are called endothermic.

#adiabatic, #process/endothermic, #process/exothermic

The mathematical expression of the first law is

$$
\Sigma{}dU=\Sigma{}dq + \Sigma{}dw = 0
$$

where $U$, $q$ and $w$ are the internal energy, the heat and the work, and each summation covers all systems participating in the process. Applications of the first law involve merely accounting processes. Whenever any process occurs, the net energy taken up by the given system will be exactly equal to the energy lost by the surroundings and vice versa, *i.e.* simply the principle of conservation of energy.

 In the present book we are primarily concerned with the work arising from a change in volume. In the simplest example, work is done when a gas expands and drives back the surrounding atmosphere. The work done when a system expands its volume by an infinitesimal small amount $dV$ against a constant external pressure is

$$
dw = -p_{ext}dV
$$
#energy/work/mechanical #energy/work/electromagnetic 

Table 1.1 Conjugate pairs of variables in work terms for the fundamental equation for the internal energy $U$. Here $f$ is force of elongation, $l$ is length in the direction of the force, $\sigma$ is surface tension, $A_s$ is surface area, $\Phi_i$ is the electric potential of the phase containing species $i$, $q_i$ is the contribution of species $i$ to the electric charge of a phase, $\mathbf{E}$ is electric field strength, $\mathbf{p}$ is the electric dipole moment of the system, $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field strength (magnetic flux density), and $\mathbf{m}$ is the magnetic moment of the system. The dots indicate scalar products of vectors.
 ![[ch01/tab1_1.png]]

The negative sign shows that the internal energy of the system doing the work
decreases.

In general, $dw$ is written in the form *(intensive variable)-d(extensive variable)* or as a product of a force times a displacement of some kind. Several types of work terms may be involved in a single thermodynamic system, and electrical, mechanical, magnetic and gravitational fields are of special importance in certain applications of materials. A number of types of work that may be involved in a thermodynamic system are summed up in Table 1.1. The last column gives the form of work in the equation for the internal energy.

### Heat capacity and definition of enthalpy

In general, the change in internal energy or simply the energy of a system $U$ may now be written as

$$
dU = dq + dw_{pV} + dw_{non-e}
$$

where $dw_{pV}$ and $dw_{non-e}$ are the expansion (or $pV$) work and the additional non-expansion (or non-$pV$) work, respectively. A system kept at constant volume cannot do expansion work; hence in this case $dw_{pV}=0$. If the system also does not do any other kind of work, then $dw_{non-e}=0$. So here the first law yields

$$
dU = dq_{V}
$$
where the subscript denotes a change at constant volume. For a measurable change, the increase in the internal energy of a substance is


$$
\Delta{}U = q_{V}
$$

#energy/heat-capacity

The temperature dependence of the internal energy is given by the **heat capacity at constant volume** at a given temperature, formally defined by

$$
C_{V}=\left(\dfrac{\partial{}U}{\partial{}T}\right)_{V}
$$

For a constant-volume system, an infinitesimal change in temperature gives an infinitesimal change in internal energy and the constant of proportionality is the heat capacity at constant volume

$$
dU = C_{V}dT
$$

The change in internal energy is equal to the heat supplied only when the system is confined to a constant volume. When the system is free to change its volume, some of the energy supplied as heat is returned to the surroundings as expansion work. Work due to the expansion of a system against a constant external pressure, $p_{ext}$ gives the following change in internal energy:

$$
dU = dq + dw = dq - p_{ext}dV
$$

#energy/enthalpy #function/enthalpy

For processes taking place at constant pressure it is convenient to introduce the enthalpy function, $H$, defined as

$$
H = U + pV
$$

Differentiation gives

$$
dH = d(U + pV) = dq + dw + Vdp + pdV
$$

When only work against a constant external pressure is done:

$$
dw = -p_{ext}dV
$$

and equation (1.10) becomes

$$
dH = dq + Vdp
$$

Since $dp = 0$ (constant pressure),

$$
dH = dq_{p}
$$

and

$$
\Delta{}H=q_{p}
$$

#energy/heat-capacity 

The enthalpy of a substance increases when its temperature is raised. The temperature dependence of the enthalpy is given by the **heat capacity at constant pressure** at a given temperature, formally defined by

$$
C_{p}=\left(\dfrac{\partial{}H}{\partial{}T}\right)_{p}
$$

Hence, fora constant pressure system, an infinitesimal change in temperature gives an infinitesimal change in enthalpy and the constant of proportionality is the heat capacity at constant pressure.

 $$
dH = C_{p}dT
$$

The heat capacity at constant volume and constant pressure at a given temperature are related through #To-Do/prove

$$
C_{p} - C_{V} = \dfrac{\alpha^2VT}{\kappa_T}
$$

where $\alpha$ and $\kappa_T$ are the isobaric expansivity and the isothermal compressibility respectively, defined by

$$
\alpha = \dfrac{1}{V}\left(\dfrac{\partial{}V}{\partial{}T}\right)_{p}
$$

and

$$
\kappa_T = -\dfrac{1}{V}\left(\dfrac{\partial{}V}{\partial{}p}\right)_{T}
$$

#property/isothermal-compressibility #property/isobaric-expansivity

Typical values of the isobaric expansivity and the isothermal compressibility are given in Table 1.2. The difference between the heat capacities at constant volume and constant pressure is generally negligible for solids at low temperatures where the thermal expansivity becomes very small, but the difference increases with temperature; see for example the data for $Al_2O_3$ in Figure 1.2.

![[ch01/fig1_2.png]]

expansivity and isothermal compressibility of Al2O3 as a function of temperature.

Since the heat absorbed or released by a system at constant pressure is equal to its change in enthalpy, enthalpy is often called heat content. If a phase transformation (*i.e.* melting or transformation to another solid polymorph) takes place within the system, heat may be adsorbed or released without a change in temperature. At constant pressure the heat merely transforms a portion of the substance (*e.g.* from solid to liquid - ice - water). Such a change is called a first-order phase transition and will be defined formally in [Chapter 2](Chapter02.md). The standard enthalpy of aluminium relative to 0 K is given as a function of temperature in Figure 1.3. The standard enthalpy of fusion and in particular the standard enthalpy of vaporization contribute significantly to the total enthalpy increment.

![[ch01/fig1_3.png]]
Figure 1.3 Standard enthalpy of aluminium relative to 0 K. The standard enthalpy of fusion ($\Delta_{fus}H_m^0$) is significantly smaller than the standard enthalpy of vaporization ($\Delta_{vap}H_m^0$).

### Reference and standard states

Thermodynamics deals with processes and reactions and is rarely concerned with the absolute values of the internal energy or enthalpy of a system, for example, only with the changes in these quantities. Hence the energy changes must be well defined. It is often convenient to choose a reference state as an arbitrary zero. Often the reference state of a condensed element/compound is chosen to be at a pressure of 1 bar and in the most stable polymorph of that element/compound at the temperature at which the reaction or process is taking place. This reference state is called a standard state due to its large practical importance.  The term standard state and the symbol $^0$ are reserved for $p = 1\:bar$. The term reference state will be used for states obtained from standard states by a change of pressure. It is important to note that the standard state chosen should be specified explicitly, since it is indeed possible to choose different standard states. The standard state may even be a virtual state, one that cannot be obtained physically.

#energy/enthalpy/reference-state #energy/enthalpy/standard-state

Let us give an example of a standard state that not involves the most stable polymorph of the compound at the temperature at which the system is considered. Cubic zirconia, $ZrO_2$, is a fast-ion conductor stable only above 2300 °C. Cubic zirconia can, however, be stabilized to lower temperatures by forming a solid solution with for example $Y_2O_3$ or $CaO$. The composition-temperature stability field of this important phase is marked by $Css$ in the $ZrO_2$-$CaZrO_3$ phase diagram shown in Figure 1.4 (phase diagrams are treated formally in [Chapter 4](Chapter04.md)). In order to describe the thermodynamics of this solid solution phase at, for example, 1500 °C, it is convenient to define the metastable cubic high-temperature modification of zirconia as the standard state instead of the tetragonal modification that is stable at 1500 °C. The standard state of pure $ZrO_2$ (used as a component of the solid solution) and the investigated solid solution thus take the same crystal structure.

The standard state for gases is discussed in [Chapter 2](Chapter02.md).

tetragonal and cubic solid solutions.

### Enthalpy of physical transformations and chemical reactions

The enthalpy that accompanies a change of physical state at standard conditions is called the standard enthalpy of transition and is denoted $\Delta_{trs}H^0$. Enthalpy changes accompanying chemical reactions at standard conditions are in general termed standard enthalpies of reaction and denoted $\Delta_{r}H^0$. Two simple examples are given in Table 1.3. In general, from the first law, the standard enthalpy of a reaction is given by

$$
\Delta_rH^0 = \sum_j{\nu_jH_m^0(j)} - \sum_i{\nu_iH_m^0(i)}
$$

where the sum is over the standard molar enthalpy of the reactants $i$ and products $j$ ($\nu_i$ and $\nu_i$; are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products in the chemical reaction).


Table 1.3 Examples of a physical transformation and a chemical reaction and their respective enthalpy changes. Here $\Delta_{fus}H_m^0$ denotes the standard molar enthalpy of fusion.
![[ch01/tab1_3.png]]

#energy/enthalpy/formation 

Of particular importance is the standard molar enthalpy of formation, $\Delta_{f}H_m^0$ which corresponds to the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpies of formation of three different modifications of $Al_2SiO_5$ are given as examples in Table 1.4 (3). Compounds like these, which are formed by combination of electropositive and electronegative elements, generally have large negative enthalpies of formation due to the formation of strong covalent or ionic bonds. In contrast, the difference in enthalpy of formation between the different modifications is small. This is more easily seen by consideration of the enthalpies of formation of these ternary oxides from their binary constituent oxides, often termed the standard molar enthalpy of formation from oxides, $\Delta_{f,ox}H_m^0$, which correspond to $\Delta_{r}H_m^0$ for the reaction

$$
SiO_2(s) + Al_2O_3(s) = Al_2SiO_5(s)
$$

Table 1.4 The enthalpy of formation of the three polymorphs of $Al_2SiO_5$, kyanite, andalusite and sillimanite at 298.15 K (3).
![[ch01/tab1_4.png]]

These are derived by subtraction of the standard molar enthalpy of formation of the binary oxides, since standard enthalpies of individual reactions can be combined to obtain the standard enthalpy of another reaction. Thus,

$$
\Delta_{f,ox}H_m^0 = \Delta_{f}H_m^0(Al_2SiO_5) - \Delta_{f}H_m^0(Al_2O_3) - \Delta_{f}H_m^0(SiO_2)
$$

#energy/first-law/hess 

This use of the first law of thermodynamics is called **Hess's law**: The standard enthalpy of an overall reaction is the sum of the standard enthalpies of the individual reactions that can be used to describe the overall reaction of $Al_2SiO_5$.

Whereas the enthalpy of formation of $Al_2SiO_5$ from the elements is large and negative, the enthalpy of formation from the binary oxides is much less so. $\Delta_{f,ox}H_m$ is furthermore comparable to the enthalpy of transition between the different polymorphs, as shown for $Al_2SiO_5$ in Table 1.5 (3). The enthalpy of fusion is also of similar magnitude.

Table 1.5 The enthalpy of formation of kyanite, andalusite and sillimanite from the binary constituent oxides (3). The enthalpy of transition between the different polymorphs is also given. All enthalpies are given for T= 298.15 K.
![[ch01/tab1_5.png]]

#energy/enthalpy/reaction 

The temperature dependence of reaction enthalpies can be determined from the heat capacity of the reactants and products. When a substance is heated from $T_1$ to $T_2$ at a particular pressure $p$, assuming no phase transition is taking place, its molar enthalpy change from $\Delta{}H_m(T_1)$ to $\Delta{}H_m(T_2)$ is

$$
\Delta{}H_m(T_2)=\Delta{}H_m(T_1) + \int_{T_1}^{T_2}C_{p,m}dT
$$

This equation applies to each substance in a reaction and a change in the standard reaction enthalpy (*i.e.* $p$ is now $p^0$ = 1 bar) going from $T_1$ to $T_2$ is given by

$$
\Delta_{r}H_m^0(T_2)=
\Delta_{r}H_m^0(T_1) +
\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\Delta_{r}C_{p,m}^0dT
$$

where $\Delta_{r}C_{p,m}^0$ is the difference in the standard molar heat capacities at constant pressure of the products and reactants under standard conditions taking the stoichiometric coefficients that appear in the chemical equation into consideration:

$$
\Delta_{r}C_{p,m}^0=
\sum_j\nu_jC_{p,m}^0(j) -
\sum_i\nu_iC_{p,m}^0(i)
$$

The heat capacity difference is in general small for a reaction involving condensed phases only.

## The second and third laws of thermodynamics

### The second law and the definition of entropy

#function/state #function/entropy

A system can in principle undergo an indefinite number of processes under the constraint that energy is conserved. While the first law of thermodynamics identifies the allowed changes, a new state function, the entropy $S$, is needed to identify the spontaneous changes among the allowed changes. The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed as: *The entropy of a system and its surroundings increases in the course of a spontaneous change, $\Delta{}S_{tot}>0$.*

The law implies that for a reversible process, the sum of all changes in entropy, taken over all the systems participating in the process, $\Delta{}S_{tot}$, is zero.

### Reversible and non-reversible processes

Any change in state of a system in thermal and mechanical contact with its surroundings at a given temperature is accompanied by a change in entropy of the system, $dS$, and of the surroundings, $dS_{sur}$:

$$
dS + dS_{sur} \ge 0
$$


#process/reversible #process/irreversible

The sum is equal to zero for reversible processes, where the system is always under equilibrium conditions, and larger than zero for irreversible processes. The entropy change of the surroundings is defined as

$$
dS_{sur}=-\dfrac{dq}{T}
$$

where $dq$ is the heat supplied to the system during the process. It follows that for any change:

$$
dS \ge \dfrac{dq}{T}
$$

which is known as the **Clausius inequality**. If we are looking at an isolated system 

$$
dS\ge{}0
$$

#clausius-inequality

Hence, for an isolated system, the entropy of the system alone must increase when a spontaneous process takes place. The second law identifies the spontaneous changes, but in terms of both the system and the surroundings. However, it is possible to consider the specific system only. This is the topic of the next section.

### Conditions for equilibrium and the definition of Helmholtz and Gibbs energies

Let us consider a closed system in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at a given temperature $T$, where no non-expansion work is possible. Imagine a change in the system and that the energy change is taking place as a heat exchange between the system and the surroundings. The Clausius inequality (eq. 1.28) may then be expressed as

$$
dS - \dfrac{dq}{T} \ge{}0
$$

If the heat is transferred at constant volume and no non-expansion work is done,

$$
dS - \dfrac{dU}{T} \ge{}0
$$

The combination of the Clausius inequality (eq. 1.30) and the first law of thermodynamics for a system at constant volume thus gives

$$
TdS\ge{}dU
$$


Correspondingly, when heat is transferred at constant pressure ($pV$ work only),

$$
TdS\ge{}dH
$$

>[!NOTE] Demonstration
>| $dU = dq + dW = dq - pdV \implies{} dq = dU + pdV = d(U + pV) = dH$

#energy/helmholtz #energy/gibbs

For convenience, two new thermodynamic functions are defined, the Helmholtz
($A$) and Gibbs ($G$) energies:

$$
A = U - TS
$$
and

$$
G = H - TS
$$

For an infinitesimal change in the system

$$
dA = dU - TdS - SdT
$$
and

$$
dG = dH - TdS - SdT
$$

At constant temperature eqs. (1.36) and (1.37) reduce to

$$
dA = dU - TdS
$$
and

$$
dG = dH - TdS
$$

#equilibrium 

Thus for a system at constant temperature and volume, the equilibrium condition is 

$$
dA_{T,V} = 0
$$
In a process at constant $T$ and $V$ in a closed system doing only expansion work it follows from eq. (1.32) that the spontaneous direction of change is in the direction of decreasing $A$. At equilibrium the value of $A$ is at a minimum. For a system at constant temperature and pressure, the equilibrium condition is

$$
dG_{T,p} = 0\qquad\text{(1.41)}
$$

In a process at constant $T$ and $p$ in a closed system doing only expansion work it follows from eq. (1.33) that the spontaneous direction of change is in the direction of decreasing $G$. At equilibrium the value of $G$ is at a minimum.


Equilibrium conditions in terms of internal energy and enthalpy are less applicable since these correspond to systems at constant entropy and volume and at constant entropy and pressure, respectively

$$
dU_{S,V} = 0\qquad\text{(1.42)}
$$

$$
dH_{S,p} = 0\qquad\text{(1.43)}
$$

The Helmholtz and Gibbs energies on the other hand involve constant temperature and volume and constant temperature and pressure, respectively. Most experiments are done at constant $T$ and $p$, and most simulations at constant $T$ and $V$. Thus, we have now defined two functions of great practical use. In a spontaneous process at constant $p$ and $T$ or constant $p$ and $V$, the Gibbs or Helmholtz energies, respectively, of the system decrease. These are, however, only other measures of the second law and imply that the total entropy of the system and the surroundings increases.

### Maximum work and maximum non-expansion work

The Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are useful also in that they define the maximum work and the maximum non-expansion work a system can do, respectively. The combination of the Clausius inequality TdS > dg and the first law of thermodynamics dU =dg + dw gives

dw = dU —TdS (1.44)

Thus the maximum work (the most negative value of dw) that can be done by a system is

dWypax = dU -TdS (1.45)

At constant temperature dA = dU — TdS and

Wmax = 4A (1.46)

If the entropy of the system decreases some of the energy must escape as heat in order to produce enough entropy in the surroundings to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. Hence the maximum work is less than| AU |. AA is the part of the change in internal energy that is free to use for work. Hence the Helmholtz energy is in some older books termed the (isothermal) work content.

The total amount of work is conveniently separated into expansion (or pV) work and non-expansion work.

dw =dWyon-e — PAV (1.47)


For a system at constant pressure it can be shown that

dw =dH -TdS (1.48)

non -e,max

At constant temperature dG = dH — TdS and
Wnon-emax = AG (1.49)

Hence, while the change in Helmholtz energy relates to the total work, the change in Gibbs energy at constant temperature and pressure represents the maximum non-expansion work a system can do.

Since A,G° for the formation of 1 mol of water from hydrogen and oxygen gas at 298 K and | bar is —237 kJ mol-!, up to 237 kJ mol"! of ‘chemical energy’ can be converted into electrical energy in a fuel cell working at these conditions using H)(g) as fuel. Since the Gibbs energy relates to the energy free for non-expansion work, it has in previous years been called the free energy.

### The variation of entropy with temperature

For a reversible change the entropy increment is dS = dq/T. The variation of the entropy from 7| to 7 is therefore given by

Ty
edd rey
S(T) = S(T, ey 1.50
(Tz) me} r (1.50)
i

For a process taking place at constant pressure and that does not involve any non-pV work

dq rey = dH =C,dT (1.51)

and

S(Tp)= S(T) + f (1.52)

The entropy of a particular compound at a specific temperature can be determined through measurements of the heat capacity as a function of temperature, adding entropy increments connected with first-order phase transitions of the compound:

dT + Aus Sm +] Yar (1.53)

![[ch01/fig1_5.png]]
Figure 1.5 Standard entropy of aluminium relative to 0 K. The standard entropy of fusion (Agus Sm) is significantly smaller than the standard entropy of boiling (A yap Sm)-

The variation of the standard entropy of aluminium from 0 K to the melt at 3000 K is given in Figure 1.5. The standard entropy of fusion and in particular the standard entropy of vaporization contribute significantly to the total entropy increment.

Equation (1.53) applies to each substance in a reaction and a change in the standard entropy of a reaction (p is now p° = | bar) going from 7| to 72 is given by (neglecting for simplicity first-order phase transitions in reactants and products)

(1.54)

where A,C pm (T) is given by eq. (1.25).

### The third law of thermodynamics

The third law of thermodynamics may be formulated as:

If the entropy of each element in some perfect crystalline state at T= 0 K is taken
as zero, then every substance has a finite positive entropy which at T= 0 K
become zero for all perfect crystalline substances.

In a perfect crystal at 0 K all atoms are ordered in a regular uniform way and the
translational symmetry is therefore perfect. The entropy is thus zero. In order to
become perfectly crystalline at absolute zero, the system in question must be able
to explore its entire phase space: the system must be in internal thermodynamic
equilibrium. Thus the third law of thermodynamics does not apply to substances
that are not in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, such as glasses and glassy
crystals. Such non-ergodic states do have a finite entropy at the absolute zero,
called zero-point entropy or residual entropy at 0 K.

Figure 1.6 Heat capacity of rhombic and monoclinic sulfur [4,5] and the derived entropy of transition between the two polymorphs.

The third law of thermodynamics can be verified experimentally. The stable rhombic low-temperature modification of sulfur transforms to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K (p = | bar). At that temperature, 7j;s, the two polymorphs are in equilibrium and the standard molar Gibbs energies of the two modifications are equal. We therefore have

AusGm =AusHm —TsAtes Sm =0 (1.55)

It follows that the standard molar entropy of the transition can be derived from the measured standard molar enthalpy of transition through the relationship

AusSm =AtsHm / Tus (1.56)

Calorimetric experiments give A,,,H;, =401.66 J mol-! and thus Ay, 5), = 1.09 JK-! mol"! [4]. The entropies of the two modifications can alternatively be derived through integration of the heat capacities for rhombic and monoclinic sulfur given in Figure 1.6 [4,5]. The entropy difference between the two modifications, also shown in the figure, increases with temperature and at the transition temperature (368.5 K) it is in agreement with the standard entropy of transition derived from the standard enthalpy of melting. The third law of thermodynamics is thereby confirmed. The entropies of both modifications are zero at 0 K.

### The Maxwell relations

Maxwell used the mathematical properties of state functions to derive a set of useful relationships. These are often referred to as the Maxwell relations. Recall the first law of thermodynamics, which may be written as

dU =dq + dw (1.57)


For a reversible change in a closed system and in the absence of any non-expansion
work this equation transforms into

dU =TdS — pdV (1.58)

Since dU is an exact differential, its value is independent of the path. The same
value of dU is obtained whether the change is reversible or irreversible, and eq.
(1.58) applies to any change for a closed system that only does pV work. Equation
(1.58) is often called the fundamental equation. The equation shows that the
internal energy of a closed system changes in a simple way when S and V are
changed, and U can be regarded as a function of S and V. We therefore have

au (2) as+f22Z) av (1.59)

It follows from eqs. (1.58) and (1.59) that

Generally, a function f(x,y) for which an infinitesimal change may be expressed
as

is exact if

Thus since the internal energy, U, is a state function, one of the Maxwell relations
may be deduced from (eq. 1.58):

Figure 1.7 The thermodynamic square. Note that the two arrows enable one to get the right sign in the equations given in the second column in Table 1.6.

Using H =U + pV, A=U —TS andG =H —TS the remaining three Maxwell rela-
tions given in Table 1.6 are easily derived starting with the fundamental equation (eq.
1.58). A convenient method to recall these equations is the thermodynamic square
shown in Figure 1.7. On each side of the square appears one of the state functions
with the two natural independent variables given next to it. A change in the internal
energy dU, for example, is thus described in terms of dS and dV. The arrow from S to
T implies that TdS is a positive contribution to dU, while the arrow from p to V
implies that pdV is a negative contribution. Hence dU =TdS — pdV follows.

### Properties of the Gibbs energy

Thermodynamics applied to real material systems often involves the Gibbs energy,
since this is the most convenient choice for systems at constant pressure and tem-
perature. We will thus consider briefly the properties of the Gibbs energy. As the
natural variables for the Gibbs energy are T and p, an infinitesimal change, dG, can
be expressed in terms of infinitesimal changes in pressure, dp, and temperature, dT.

(1.65)


The Gibbs energy is related to enthalpy and entropy through G = H — TS. For an
infinitesimal change in the system

(1.66)

Similarly, H = U + pV gives

(1.67)

Thus in the absence of non-expansion work for a closed system, the following
important equation

 (1.68)

is easily derived using also eq. (1.58). Equations (1.65) and (1.68) implies that the
temperature derivative of the Gibbs energy at constant pressure is —S:

(1.69)

and thus that

(1.70)

where i and f denote the initial and final p and T conditions. Since S is positive fora compound, the Gibbs energy of a compound decreases when temperature is increased at constant pressure. G decreases most rapidly with temperature when S is large and this fact leads to entropy-driven melting and vaporization of compounds when the temperature is raised. The standard molar Gibbs energy of solid, liquid and gaseous aluminium is shown as a function of temperature in Figure 1.8. The corresponding enthalpy and entropy is given in Figures 1.2 and 1.5. The melting (vaporization) temperature is given by the temperature at which the Gibbs energy of the solid (gas) and the liquid crosses, as marked in Figure 1.8. Equation (1.70) applies to each substance in a reaction and a change in the standard Gibbs energy of a reaction (p is now p® = | bar) going from 7; to Tf is given by

(1.71)

A,S° is not necessarily positive and the Gibbs energy of a reaction may increase
with temperature.


![[ch01/fig1_8.png]]
Figure 1.8 Standard Gibbs energy of solid, liquid and gaseous aluminium relative to the standard Gibbs energy of solid aluminium at T= 0 K as a function of temperature (at p = 1 bar).

The pressure derivative of the Gibbs energy (eq. 1.68) at constant temperature is

(1.72)

and the pressure variation of the Gibbs energy is given as

(1.73)

Since V is positive for a compound, the Gibbs energy of a compound increases
when pressure is increased at constant temperature. Thus, while disordered phases
are stabilized by temperature, high-density polymorphs (lower molar volumes) are
stabilized by pressure. Figure 1.9 show that the Gibbs energy of graphite due to its
open structure increases much faster with pressure than that for diamond. Graphite
thus transforms to the much denser diamond modification of carbon at 1.5 GPa at
298 K.

Equation (1.73) applies to each substance in a reaction and a change in the Gibbs
energy of a reaction going from pj to p¢ is given by

Figure 1.10 The standard Gibbs energy of formation from the binary constitutent oxides of the kyanite, sillimanite and andalusite modifications of Al7SiOs as a function of pressure at 800 K. Data are taken from [3]. All three oxides are treated as incompressible.

A,V is not necessarily positive, and to compare the relative stability of the different modifications of a ternary compound like AlpSiOs the volume of formation of the ternary oxide from the binary constituent oxides is considered for convenience. The pressure dependence of the Gibbs energies of formation from the binary constituent oxides of kyanite, sillimanite and andalusite polymorphs of AljSiOs are shown in Figure 1.10. Whereas sillimanite and andalusite have positive volumes of formation and are destabilized by pressure relative to the binary oxides, kyanite has a negative volume of formation and becomes the stable high-pressure phase. The thermodynamic data used in the calculations are given in Table 1.7 [3].!

## Open systems

### Definition of the chemical potential

A homogeneous open system consists of a single phase and allows mass transfer across its boundaries. The thermodynamic functions depend not only on temperature and pressure but also on the variables necessary to describe the size of the system and its composition. The Gibbs energy of the system is therefore a function of T, p and the number of moles of the chemical components i, n;: G=G(T,p,n;) (1.75)

The exact differential of G may be written

(1.76)

The partial derivatives of G with respect to T and p, respectively, we recall are -S and V. The partial derivative of G with respect to nj is the chemical potential of component /, Ll;

(1.77)

Equation (1.68) can for an open system be expressed as

 (1.78)

The internal energy, enthalpy and Helmholtz energy can be expressed in an analogous manner:


(1.79)

(1.80)

(1.81)

The chemical potential is thus defined by any of the following partial derivatives:

### Conditions for equilibrium in a heterogeneous system


Recall that the equilibrium condition for a closed system at constant T and p was given by eq. (1.41). For an open system the corresponding equation is

(1.83)

For such a system, which allows transfer of both heat and mass, the chemical potential of each species must be the same in all phases present in equilibrium; hence

 (1.84)

Here a, B and y denote different phases in the system, whereas i denotes the different components of the system.

### Partial molar properties

In open systems consisting of several components the thermodynamic properties of each component depend on the overall composition in addition to T and p. Chemical thermodynamics in such systems relies on the partial molar properties of the components. The partial molar Gibbs energy at constant p, T and nj (eq. 1.77) has been given a special name due to its great importance: the chemical potential. The corresponding partial molar enthalpy, entropy and volume under the same conditions are defined as

(1.85)
(1.86)

(1.87)

Note that the partial molar derivatives may also be taken under conditions other than constant p and 7.

### The Gibbs-Duhem equation

In the absence of non pV-work, an extensive property such as the Gibbs energy of a
system can be shown to be a function of the partial derivatives:

(1.88)

In this context G itself is often referred to as the integral Gibbs energy. For a binary system consisting of the two components A and B the integral Gibbs

energy eq. (1.88) is

(1.89)

Differentiation of eq. (1.89) gives

dG =nadua +daaty +ngdig +dngug (1.90)

By using eq. (1.78) at constant T and p, G is also given by

(1.91)

By combining the two last equations, the Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary system at constant 7 and p is obtained:

(1.92)

In general, for an arbitrary system with i components, the Gibbs-Duhem equation is obtained by combining eq. (1.78) and eq. (1.90):

(1.93)

Expressions for the other intensive parameters such as V, S and H can also be derived:

 (1.94)

 (1.95)
 (1.96)

The physical significance of the Gibbs-Duhem equation is that the chemical potential of one component in a solution cannot be varied independently of the chemical potentials of the other components of the solution. This relation will be further discussed and used in [Chapter 3](Chapter03.md).
