Single-component systems

This chapter introduces additional central concepts of thermodynamics and gives
an overview of the formal methods that are used to describe single-component sys-
tems. The thermodynamic relationships between different phases of a single-com-
ponent system are described and the basics of phase transitions and phase diagrams
are discussed. Formal mathematical descriptions of the properties of ideal and real
gases are given in the second part of the chapter, while the last part is devoted to the
thermodynamic description of condensed phases.

2.1 Phases, phase transitions and phase diagrams

Phases and phase transitions

In Chapter | we introduced the term phase. A phase is a state that has a particular
composition and also definite, characteristic physical and chemical properties. We
may have several different phases that are identical in composition but different in
physical properties. A phase can be in the solid, liquid or gas state. In addition,
there may exist more than one distinct crystalline phase. This is termed polymor-

 

  

phism, and each crystalline phase represents a distinct polymorph of the substance.

A transition between two phases of the same substance at equilibrium is called a
first-order phase transition. At the equilibrium phase transition temperature the
equilibrium condition eq. (1.84) yields

(2.1)

 

where qand B denote the two coexisting phases. In this chapter we are only consid-
ering single component systems (i= 1) and for simplicity eq. (2.1) is expressed as

Thus the molar Gibbs energies of the two phases are the same at equilibrium.

Typical first-order phase transitions are for example melting of ice and vaporization of
water at p = | bar and at 0° and 99.999 °C, respectively. First-order phase transitions
are accompanied by discontinuous changes in enthalpy, entropy and volume. H, S and V
are thermodynamically given through the first derivatives of the chemical potential with
regard to temperature or pressure, and transitions showing discontinuities in these func-
tions are for that reason termed first-order. By using the first derivatives of the Gibbs
energy with respect to p and 7, defined in eqs. (1.69) and (1.72), the changes in the slopes
of the chemical potential at the transition temperature are given as

Here AusVin» Aus Sm and Aj,,H , are the changes in the molar volume, entropy
and enthalpy connected with the phase transition. Phases separated by a first-order
transition can be present together with a distinct interface, and the phases are thus
coexistent under certain conditions. For a single component system like HO, ice
and water are coexistent at the melting temperature. The same is true at the first-
order transition between two crystalline polymorphs of a given compound. The
changes in heat capacity at constant pressure, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy
at the first-order semi-conductor—metal transition in NiS [1] are shown in Figure
2.1. The heat capacity at constant pressure is the second derivative of the Gibbs
energy and is given macroscopically by the temperature increment caused by an
enthalpy increment; C, = AH/AT. Since the first-order transition takes place at con-
stant temperature, the heat capacity in theory should be infinite at the transition
temperature. This is obviously not observed experimentally, but heat capacities of
the order of 107-108 J K-! mol-! are observed on melting of pure metals [2].

Transformations that involve discontinuous changes in the second derivatives of
the Gibbs energy with regard to temperature and pressure are correspondingly
termed second-order transitions. For these transitions we have discontinuities in
the heat capacity, isothermal compressibility and isobaric expansivity:

Modifications separated by a second-order transition can never be coexistent.
One typical second-order transition, the displacive structural transition, is charac-
terized by the distortion of bonds rather than their breaking, and the structural
changes that occur are usually small. Typically, there is continuous variation in the
positional parameters and the unit cell dimensions as a function of temperature.
The structural changes in the system occur gradually as the system moves away
from the transition point. As well as a structural similarity, a symmetry relationship

example, and the two modifications of SiOz are illustrated in Figure 2.2. a-quartz is
most easily considered as a distorted version of high-temperature B-quartz. When B-
quartz is cooled below 573 °C at | bar the framework of the structure collapses to the
denser o-configuration. The mean Si-O bond distances hardly change, but the
Si-O-Si bond angle decreases from 150.9° at 590 °C to 143.61° at room temperature

energy with temperature in the transition region [5] are given in Figure 2.3. While the

transitions do not have any restrictions concerning the symmetries of the two phases.

transition is barely seen in the Gibbs energy, it gives rise to a change of slope in
enthalpy and volume and to a discontinuity in the heat capacity.

It is possible that both the first and second derivatives of the Gibbs energy are
continuous, and that the discontinuous changes occur in the third-order derivatives
of the Gibbs energy. The corresponding transition would be of third order. In prac-
tice, itis difficult to decide experimentally whether or not there is a discontinuity in
the heat capacity, thermal expansivity or isothermal compressibility at the transi-
tion temperature. Even small jumps in these properties, which are difficult to verify
experimentally, will signify a second-order transition. Hence it is common to call
all transitions with continuous first-order derivatives second-order transitions.
Similarly, it may be difficult to distinguish some first-order transitions from
second-order transitions due to kinetics.

Slopes of the phase boundaries

A phase boundary for a single-component system shows the conditions at which
two phases coexist in equilibrium. Recall the equilibrium condition for the phase
equilibrium (eq. 2.2). Let p and T change infinitesimally but in a way that leaves the
two phases @and in equilibrium. The changes in chemical potential must be iden-
tical, and hence

du® =dp? (2.8)

An infinitesimal change in the Gibbs energy can be expressed as dG = Vdp — SdT
(eq. 1.68) and eq. (2.8) becomes

-s“dT +V2dp=-sB ar +vBdp (2.9)
Equation (2.9) can be rearranged to the Clapeyron equation:

The variation of the phase transition temperature with pressure can be calculated
from the knowledge of the volume and enthalpy change of the transition. Most
often both the entropy and volume changes are positive and the transition tempera-
ture increases with pressure. In other cases, notably melting of ice, the density of
the liquid phase is larger than of the solid, and the transition temperature decreases

shown in Figure 2.4.

It should be noted that the boiling temperature of all substances varies more rap-
idly with pressure than their melting temperature since the large volume change
during vaporization gives a small dp/d7. For a liquid—vapour or solid-vapour

2.1 Phases, phase transitions and phase diagrams 35

Second-order transitions do not involve coexisting phases but are transitions in
which the structural properties gradually change within a single phase. The low-
and high-temperature modifications are here two modifications of the same phase.
Hence, although these transitions often are represented in phase diagrams, they are
not heterogeneous phases and do not obey Gibbs’ phase rule (see below). There is
no discontinuous change in the first derivatives of the Gibbs energy at the transition
temperature for a second-order transition, and the volumes of the two phases are
thus equal. The change in volume, dV, must be equal for both modifications if the
transition is to remain continuous. Taking into account that V is a function of tem-
perature and pressure and by using the definitions of the isobaric expansivity and
the isothermal compressibility:

system: pressure, temperature, composition and, if applicable, other variables such
as electric or magnetic field strengths. In this chapter we are considering single
component systems only. For a single-component system the phase diagram dis-
plays the regions of pressure and temperature where the various phases of this com-
ponent are stable. The lines separating the regions — the phase boundaries — define
the p,T conditions at which two phases of the component coexist in equilibrium.

Let us initially consider a single-component phase diagram involving a solid, a
liquid and a gaseous phase. The p, T phase diagram of HO is given as an example in
Figure 2.7. The transformations between the different phases are of first order. The
liquid—vapour phase boundary shows how the vapour pressure of the liquid varies
with temperature. Similarly, the solid-vapour phase boundary gives the tempera-
ture variation of the sublimation vapour pressure of the solid.

The temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid is equal to the external
pressure is called the boiling temperature at that pressure. The standard boiling
temperature is the boiling temperature at 1 bar. Correspondingly, the standard
melting temperature is the melting temperature at 1 bar. Boiling is not observed
when a liquid is heated in a closed vessel. Instead, the vapour pressure increases
continuously as temperature is raised. The density of the vapour phase increases
while the density of the liquid decreases. At the temperature where the densities of
the liquid and the vapour become equal, the interface between the liquid and the
gas disappears and we have reached the critical temperature of the substance, 7,.
This is visualized by using volume (or if preferred, density) as a third variable ina
three-dimensional (p,7,V) phase diagram — see Figure 2.8. The vapour pressure at
the critical temperature is called the critical pressure. A single uniform phase, the
supercritical fluid, exists above the critical temperature.

For a single-component system p and T can be varied independently when only
one phase is present. When two phases are present in equilibrium, pressure and
temperature are not independent variables. At a certain pressure there is only one
temperature at which the two phases coexist, e.g. the standard melting temperature
of water. Hence at a chosen pressure, the temperature is given implicitly. A point

where three phases coexist in equilibrium is termed a triple point; three phases are
in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure. Ice, water and water vapour are
in equilibrium at T= 273.16 K and p= 611 Pa. None of the intensive parameters can
be changed. The observer cannot affect the triple point.

The relationship between the number of degrees of freedom, F, defined as the
number of intensive parameters that can be changed without changing the number
phases in equilibrium, and the number of phases, Ph, and components, C, in the
system is expressed through Gibbs phase rule:

F=C-Ph+2 (2.15)

In Chapter 4 the determination of the number of components in complex systems
will be discussed in some detail. In this chapter we shall only consider single-com-
ponent systems. For a single-component system, such as pure H20, C= | and F=3
—Ph. Thus, a single phase (Ph = 1) is represented by an area in the p,7 diagram and
the number of degrees of freedom F is 2. A line in the phase diagram represents a
heterogeneous equilibrium between two coexisting phases (Ph = 2) and F = 1,
while three phases (PA = 3) in equilibrium are located at a point, F = 0.

Field-induced phase transitions

Various types of work in addition to pV work are frequently involved in experi-
mental studies. Research on chemical equilibria for example may involve surfaces
or phases at different electric or magnetic potentials [11]. We will here look briefly
at field-induced transitions, a topic of considerable interest in materials science.
Examples are stress-induced formation of piezoelectric phases, electric polariza-
tion-induced formation of dielectrica and field-induced order—disorder transitions,
such as for environmentally friendly magnetic refrigeration.

Magnetic contributions to the Gibbs energy due to an internal magnetic field are
present in all magnetically ordered materials. An additional energetic contribution

---
38 2 Single-component systems
arises in a magnetic field with field strength or magnetic flux density B. This contribu-
tion is proportional to the magnetic moment, m, of the system and thus is B-dm. An
important additional complexity of external fields is that the field has a direction; the
field can be applied parallel to any of the three principal axes of a single crystal. The
magnetic moment and the magnetic field are thus vectors and represented by bold
symbols. The fundamental equation for the internal energy for a system involving
magnetic polarization is when the pV work is negligible (constant volume):

dU=TdS+B-dm (2.16)
The corresponding equation for the Helmholtz energy is

dA =-SdT+B-dm (2.17)

In order to focus on the driving force for phase transitions induced by a magnetic

field it is advantageous to use the magnetic flux density as an intensive variable.
This can be achieved through what is called a Legendre transform [12]. A trans-
formed Helmholtz energy is defined as

A'=A-B-m=0 (2.18)
Taking the differential of A’ and substituting for dA in eq. (2.17):

dA’=dA—B-dm -m-dB =-SdT-m-dB (2.19)

Assuming an isotropic system, the following Maxwell relation can be derived from
eq. (2.19), since dA’ is an exact differential:

($) -(=} (2.20)
B)ry \OT Igy

The entropy of a ferromagnetically ordered phase decreases with increasing

 

magnetic field strength. The decrease is equal to the change in the magnetic
moment with temperature and hence is large close to the order—-disorder tempera-
ture. This implies that a larger change in the magnetic moment with temperature at
constant field strength gives a higher entropy change connected with a field change
at constant temperature. The effect of a magnetic field on the Helmholtz energy of a
magnetic order—disorder transition thus clearly affects phase stability.

The application of n additional thermodynamic potentials (of electric, magnetic
or other origin) implies that the Gibbs phase rule must be rewritten to take these
new potentials into account:

Three different magnetically ordered phases — ferro, fan and screw — are separated by first-
order phase transitions. The transitions to the disordered paramagnetic state are of second
order and given by a dashed line.

The isobaric (1 bar) 7,B-phase diagram of MnP with magnetic field parallel to
the crystallographic b-axis [13] is given in Figure 2.9. At isobaric conditions,
where one degree of freedom is lost, the number of phases and the number of
degrees of freedom are related by F + Ph = 3. Thus areas in the 7,B diagram corre-
spond to a single phase; a line corresponds to two phases in equilibrium; and three
phases may exist in equilibrium at an invariant point, the triple point. It should be
noted that the fact that a magnetic field can be applied parallel to any of the three
principal axes of a single crystal implies that different phase diagrams will result in
each case for a non-cubic crystal.

2.2 The gas phase

Ideal gases
The thermodynamic properties of gases are given through equations of state (EoS)
which in general may be given as

p=f(T,Vin) (2.22)

For an ideal gas the equation of state is known as the ideal gas law:

_ nRT (2.23)
Vv

where R is the gas constant and n is the number of moles of gas. The Gibbs energy

of a gas at one pressure (pf) relative to that at another pressure (pj) is at constant

temperature given through

For any single-component system such as a pure gas the molar Gibbs energy is
identical to the chemical potential, and the chemical potential for an ideal gas is
thus expressed as

Mp) = 1° (p®) + RT Hf Jen +RT Inp (2.26)
Pp

where the standard chemical potential (u°) is the standard molar Gibbs energy of
the pure ideal gas at the standard pressure | bar (p®).

The value of this standard molar Gibbs energy, °(7’), found in data compila-
tions, is obtained by integration from 0 K of the heat capacity determined by the
translational, rotational, vibrational and electronic energy levels of the gas. These
are determined experimentally by spectroscopic methods [14]. However, contrary
to what we shall see for condensed phases, the effect of pressure often exceeds the
effect of temperature. Hence for gases most attention is given to the equations of
state.

Real gases and the definition of fugacity

Real gases do not obey the ideal gas law, but the ideal gas law is often a very good
approximation. The largest deviation from ideal gas behaviour is observed at high
pressures and low temperatures. Figure 2.10 displays schematically the pressure
dependence of the chemical potential. For practical reasons, it is advantageous to
have an expression for the chemical potential of the real gas, which resembles that
used for perfect gases. In order to obtain a simple expression for the chemical
potential we replace the ideal pressure in the expression for the chemical potential
(eq. 2.26) with the effective pressure, the fugacity, f, and we have

The standard state for a real gas is thus a hypothetical state in which the gas is at a
pressure of p° = | bar and behaving ideally.

Most applications in materials science are carried out under pressures which do
not greatly exceed | bar and the difference between fand p is small, as can be seen
from the fugacity of No(g) at 273.15 K [15] given in Figure 2.11. Hence, the
fugacity is often set equal to the partial pressure of the gas, i.e. fp. More accurate
descriptions of the relationship between fugacity and pressure are needed in other
cases and here equations of state of real, non-ideal gases are used.

Equations of state of real gases

Purely phenomenological as well as physically based equations of state are used to
represent real gases. The deviation from perfect gas behaviour is often small, and
the perfect gas law is a natural choice for the first term in a serial expression of the

properties of real gases. The most common representation is the virial equation of
state:

PVm =RT (1+ Bip +C'p” +...) (2.28)

42 2 Single-component systems

An alternative formulation is

The coefficients B and C are the second and third virial coefficients, respectively,

ze (2.30)

For an ideal gas Z = |. Departures from the value of unity indicate non-ideal behav-
iour. Z < | can be related to dominating attractive forces, whereas Z > | relates to
repulsive forces being dominant.

The simplest physically based equation of state for real gases, the van der Waals
equation, is based on two assumptions. As pressure is increased, the number of
atoms per unit volume also increases and the volume available to the molecules in
total is reduced, since the molecules themselves take up some space. The volume
taken up by the molecules is assumed to be proportional to the number of mole-
cules, n, and the volume occupied per atom, b. The equation of state is accordingly
modified initially to

nRT
= 2.31)
p V—nb ‘

 

Secondly, since the frequency and force of the collisions with the walls of the
container give the pressure, the change in these two factors with concentration
must be taken into account. The attractive forces working between the molecules
reduce both factors, the reduction being approximately proportional to the molar
concentration (n/V). The pressure is hence reduced by a factor proportional to the
square of this concentration and is then given as

where p = p/p,,T =T/T, and V =V/V,. This is a remarkable equation because it
does not explicitly contain any free parameter characteristic of the substance and
illustrates the law of corresponding states. All real gases should, according to this
equation, behave in the same manner. The van der Waals equation of state evidently
represents an approximation only, and although it works reasonably well for gases
composed of spherical molecules it fails in many other cases.

---
44 2 Single-component systems

Even though the van der Waals equation is not as accurate for describing the
properties of real gases as empirical models such as the virial equation, it has been
and still is a fundamental and important model in statistical mechanics and chem-
ical thermodynamics. In this book, the van der Waals equation of state will be used
further to discuss the stability of fluid phases in Chapter 5.

2.3 Condensed phases

For condensed phases (liquids and solids) the molar volume is much smaller than
for gases and also varies much less with pressure. Consequently the effect of pres-
sure on the chemical potential of a condensed phase is much smaller than for a gas
and often negligible. This implies that while for gases more attention is given to the
volumetric properties than to the variation of the standard chemical potential with
temperature, the opposite is the case for condensed phases.

Variation of the standard chemical potential with temperature

The thermodynamic properties of single-component condensed phases are tradi-
tionally given in tabulated form in large data monographs. Separate tables are
given for each solid phase as well as for the liquid and for the gas. In recent years
analytical representations have been increasingly used to ease the implementation
of the data in computations. These polynomial representations typically describe
the thermodynamic properties above room temperature (or 200 K) only.

Polynomial expressions are conveniently used to represent a condensed phase
which is stable in the whole temperature range of interest and which does not
undergo any structural, electronic or magnetic transformations. The Gibbs energy
of a compound is in the CALPHAD approach represented relative to the elements
in their defined standard state at 298.15 K as a power series in terms of temperature
in the form of [16]:

i
GOT) - HSER =a 4bT +cP I(T) + Yd, T" (2.41)
n=2

Here HSER is the sum (in the stoichiometric ratio of the compound in question) of
ASHE, of the elements in their defined standard state. a, b, c and dy are coeffi-

information in databases. A number of such expressions are often required for a
given phase to cover the whole temperature range of interest. From eq. (2.41) all

These thermodynamic functions implicitly given in analytical representations are
given numerically at selected temperatures in monographs, as shown for AIN in
Table 2.1 [17]. The analytical approach is exemplified by descriptions of three
modifications of aluminium in Table 2.2 [18]. The stable face-centred cubic modi-
fication of crystalline aluminium (FCC-AI) melts at 933.473 K. Hexagonal close-
packed aluminium is unstable at all temperatures, as evident from the graphical
representation of the Gibbs energy relatively to FCC-AlI in Figure 2.12. The ther-
modynamic properties may still be needed to describe alloys with hexagonal
closed-packed structure where aluminium is a solute.

Representation of transitions

Thermodynamic representation of transitions often represents a challenge. First-
order phase transitions are more easily handled numerically than second-order
transitions. The enthalpy and entropy of first-order phase transitions can be calcu-
lated at any temperature using the heat capacity of the two phases and the enthalpy
and entropy of transition at the equilibrium transition temperature. Small pre-tran-
sitional contributions to the heat capacity, often observed experimentally, are most
often not included in the polynomial representations since the contribution to the

Gibbs energy is small. This contribution is instead incorporated empirically in the

It is more difficult to describe second-order transitions. Considerable short-range
order is in general present far above the transition temperature. Correspondingly,

considerable disordering has taken place already far below the disordering temperature.
The magnetic order—disorder transition in non-stoichiometric wiistite, Fe}_,0, may
serve as an example. The magnetic transition is largely dependent on the stoichiometry
of the compound (see Figure 2.13), and is for the oxygen-rich compositions spread over
a considerable temperature range [19]. The disordering is far from abrupt.

The Inden model [20] is frequently used to describe second-order magnetic
order-disorder transitions. Inden assumed that the heat capacity varied as a loga-
rithmic function of temperature and used separate expressions above and below the
magnetic order—disorder transition temperature (7j;s) in order to treat the effects of
both long- and short-range order. Thus for t= (7/Tirs) < 1:

The two coefficients KL and KS are derived empirically. They are related through
the entropy of transition and constrained to reproduce the total enthalpy and
entropy increments accompanying the phase transition. Since, the Inden model
demands a series expansion in order to calculate the entropy, a simpler related
equation by Hillert and Jarl [21] is used in many computer programs.
Second-order structural transitions are less frequently represented in applied
thermodynamic calculations. Still, the Landau approach for determination of

Gibbs energy changes connected with second-order transitions has a long tradi-
tion. The central concept of the Landau theory is the order parameter, I’, which
describes the course of the transition. The order parameter is related to the change
in some macroscopic property like strain, average site occupancy or crystallo-
graphic distortion through the phase transition. The measured physical property is,
however, not necessarily directly proportional to I, but most often scales as either
Tor l?. The relationship between the order parameter and the measured physical
property is defined by the differences in symmetry between the high- and low-tem-
perature polymorphs [22].

We will consider a phase transition between two crystal structures with different
symmetry and where the space group of the low-symmetry structure is a sub-group
of the space group of the high-symmetry structure. Hence all symmetry elements of
the high-symmetry structure are present in the low-symmetry structure. An order
parameter, I, is used to describe the thermodynamic state of the low-symmetry
phase. The contribution from the phase transition to the total Gibbs energy, here
termed the transitional Gibbs energy Aj,,G, is now given as a function of T, p and
as

AusG =AusG(T, pT) (2.47)

Tis scaled such that it is assigned the value 0 in the high-temperature modification
and | in the low-temperature form at 0 K. Thus, AtsG = 0 for the high-temperature
polymorph. The variation of the order parameter with temperature describes the
transition thermodynamically. In general [23]:

MisG =a +5 br +ier +tar* ben (2.48)

Here a, b, c, d etc. are coefficients that in general are functions of temperature and
pressure. The equilibrium behaviour of I” through the phase transition is deter-
mined by minimizing Ays;G with respect to I. Furthermore, at equilibrium the
AtrsG(Z) surface is concave upwards (discussed thoroughly in Section 5.2), hence

These criteria can be used to get information on the coefficients of eq. (2.48). In the
high-symmetry phase, stable above the transition temperature, the order parameter
I= 0 and the equilibrium conditions imply that the two first constants in the poly-
nomial expansion are restricted to a = 0 and b > 0. If we assume that b < 0, the low-
symmetry phase is stable since I> >Othen implies that Aj;sG < 0. The transitional
Gibbs energy is thus reduced to

The Landau theory predicts the symmetry conditions necessary for a transition to
be thermodynamically of second order. The order parameter must in this case vary
continuously from 0 to 1. The presence of odd-order coefficients in the expansion
gives rise to two values of the transitional Gibbs energy that satisfy the equilibrium
conditions. This is not consistent with a continuous change in I and thus corre-
sponds to first-order phase transitions. For this reason all odd-order coefficients
must be zero. Furthermore, the sign of b must change from positive to negative at the
transition temperature. It is customary to express the temperature dependence of b as
a linear function of temperature:

b=BI -Tys) (2.51)

Here B is a constant independent of temperature and pressure. The transitional
Gibbs energy is thus

AusG = par =Tys)P? +taré +m te. (2.52)

where d, f and higher-order coefficients all are assumed to be independent of tem-
perature and pressure. Normally two or three terms of this expression give a satis-
factory description of the transitional Gibbs energy using experimentally
determined values for the temperature variation of the order parameter.

When d > 0 the expansion describes a thermodynamic second-order transition.
The equilibrium condition neglecting higher order terms is

The contribution of the transition to the thermodynamic functions can be evalu-
ated once the coefficients B and d have been determined. Experimental determina-
tion of the transition temperature and one additional thermodynamic quantity at
one specific temperature is sufficient to describe the transition thermodynamically
using this model.

It is easily shown that a first-order phase transition is obtained for cases were
d <0, whereas behaviour at the borderline between first- and second-order transi-
tions, tricritical behaviour, is obtained for d = 0. In the latter case the transitional
Gibbs energy is

where B is the critical exponent. For our two ideal cases, second-order and

Orientational disordering of the carbonate groups in CaCO3 above 1260 K may
serve as an example of application of Landau theory. Below the transition tempera-
ture, alternate layers of planar CO3 groups point in opposite directions. In the high-
temperature modification they are free to rotate and become equivalent. The sym-
metry reduction on ordering is from space group R3m to R3c with doubling of the
c-axis length. Thus the transition gives rise to superlattice reflections in the diffrac-
tion patterns of the low-temperature phase. The intensities of these reflections are
according to symmetry considerations proportional to I. It has been shown by
neutron diffraction that the order parameter is proportional to (T1,, — T)"4 and thus
that the transition is tricritical [24]. Tj;; and the excess enthalpy determined by
drop calorimetry characterize the transition thermodynamically [25]. The contri-
bution from the transition to the total Gibbs energy and entropy (using B = 24 J

Equations of state

Equations of state of condensed materials are seldom used in materials science but
are frequently used in geophysics and to an increasing degree also in solid state sci-
ences for high-pressure studies of phase transitions. A considerable amount of
work on equations of state of minerals has been reported in the geophysical and
geochemical literature. In the Earth’s mantle the pressure is several orders of mag-
nitude higher than ambient since pressure and temperature increase with
increasing depth within the Earth. Thus equation of state data is essential for ther-
modynamic calculations of phase equilibria in the Earth’s interior.

Equations of state for solids are often cast in terms of the bulk modulus, Ky,
which is the inverse of the isothermal compressibility, «7, and thus defined as

Kr 2-2) (2.66)
OV Jr

The two most usual equations of state for representation of experimental data at
high pressure are the Murnaghan and Birch-Murnaghan equations of state. Both
models are based on finite strain theory, the Birch-Murnaghan or Eulerian strain
[26]. The main assumption in finite strain theory is the formal relationship between
compression and strain [27]:

Volumetric data for four different substances represented by the third-order
Birch—Murnaghan equation of state are shown in Figure 2.15.

The equations discussed above are reliable for phases where the compressibility
does not change too fast with pressure, more specifically for 3.4 < Kp <7.
The equations are thus suitable for a large range of crystalline substances but
not for liquids or low-dimensional materials, where K 9 is often larger than 7.
In the latter cases the universal Vinet equation of state seems more appropriate
(28].

The effect of temperature on the equation of state is introduced through the iso-
baric thermal expansivity. It is generally assumed that isobaric expansivity and iso-
baric compressibility work independently of each order and the volume as a
function of T and p is then expressed as

 

V(p,T) =Viggh tT) 2.71)

Finally, it should be noted that the effect of the compressibility on the
thermodymanics of solids is small even at relatively high pressures. The molar
volume of magnetite, Fe3O4, at 1000 K is 46.0 cm3 mol-! and VAp at p = | GPa is
46 kJ mol"! if the compressibility of the compound is neglected. Taking compress-
ibility into account reduces this contribution to 45.88 kJ mol-! [29].
