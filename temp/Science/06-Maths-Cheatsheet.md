## Linear algebra

For a full review of linear algebra, please consult ([[@Lay2012]]).

A linear system of equations may have (1) no solution, (2) exactly one solution, or (3) infinitely many solutions. Solving and analyzing them is the task of linear algebra.

### Definitions

- Echelon form
- Pivot position
- Span subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Matrix-vector product as a linear combination of columns
- 

### Theorems

- Uniqueness of the reduced echelon form: each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix.

- Existence and uniqueness: a linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is not a pivot column. In this case, the solution set contains either (1) a unique solution (no free variables), or (2) infinitely many solutions (at least one free variable).

- A system $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has the same solution set as the augmented linear system composed of the columns of $A$ appended by $\mathrm{b}$. The same is true for the equivalent vector equation, but that is self-evident from the definition of matrix-vector product.
