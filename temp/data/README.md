## Kinetic mechanisms

Kinetics mechanisms from several sources or authored.

### Oxydation of Methane

- [Lu_2008_CH4_red19](kinetics/Lu_2008_CH4_red19): 19 species CSP reduction of Gri-Mech 2.1 performed by Lu et al., 2008. Notice that mechanism does not implement rate constants and a Fortran file is provided with rates for actual computations. Not tested yet.

- [Lu_2008_CH4_sk30](kinetics/Lu_2008_CH4_sk30): 30 species DRG simplificaiton of Gri-Mech 3.0 performed by Lu et al., 2009. This mechanism provides combustion temperatures close to the base 53 species reference mechanism.

- [Zhukov_2018_sk23](kinetics/Zhukov_2018_sk23): 23 species DRG simplification of Gri-Mech 3.0 performed by Zhukov et al. 2018. This mechanism provides combustion temperatures close to the base 53 species reference mechanism with slight understimation at unity air-to-gas-ratio.

- [Methane_Low_Order](kinetics/Methane_Low_Order): some 1 and 2 reaction files. One reaction mechanism shall not be used in serious applications (illustration purposes only) and 2-reaction-mechanism is known to work properly only on lean combustion conditions.

## Thermodynamics

Thermodynamic databases for CALPHAD simulations. Documentation and validation are a work in progress.

## To-Do's

- [ ] Add DOI of reference papers.
- [ ] Standardize mechanism naming convention.
