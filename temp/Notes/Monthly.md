- Reviewed GPU limitations for Ansys Fluent. It remains NVIDIA only. Currently the models remain quite limited to simple flows and the classic turbulence model. Possibility of species transport but to reactions.

- Reviewed Ansys Tutorial Guide 2023R1 chapter regarding droplets evaporation. There is nothing there I am not already using in the models I conceive. Remember to use transient tracking and check mean properties for iso-surfaces display.

- Continued (re-)learning about UDF's. Header files seem fine if placed under an `include/` directory at project root (not case root!). Simulations can be made more flexible by using Scheme variables which can be parsed by UDF's.

- Downloading files from Analysis of Transport Phenomena at MITx.

- Worked on random walk diffusion models at microscopic scale. Started a draft of a tutorial for moving particles in a square grid in Julia.

- Continued working on diffusion, now writing down the draft of the course. I think an annex of thermodynamics or even dedicated chapters might be required, to be defined.
