- Take care, paper content is poor and full of typos!
- Derivation for semi-infinite media
- Temperature dependent heat capacity
- Can we really say $h=\rho{}c_{p}T$ in all cases?
- Argument about lack of exponents in literature is poor. In fact data is fitted to polynomials mainly because simple exponentials as proposed by the author would not properly represent experimental data in most cases (and certainly not fit Calphad requirements)!
