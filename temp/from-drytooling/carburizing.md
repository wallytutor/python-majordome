# Validation of iron carburizing model

The model hereafter introduced makes use of the diffusion coefficients provided by Slycke and Ericsson [Slycke1981](@cite) [Slycke1981a](@cite). Simulation conditions and results are to be confronted with those provided by Dal'Maz Silva *et al.* [DalMazSilva2017](@cite).

## Common conditions

Some conditions listed below will be shared across the simulations that follow. In the block below we find space discretization and physical conditions for model setup. Solver parameters are irrelevant in what follows and are kept hidden in the setup block (for checking them, please consider consulting the raw documentation files in project repository).

```@example carburizing
N = 100       # Number of cells
L = 0.002     # Length [m]
T = 1173.15   # Temperature [K]
τ = 50.0      # Characteristic time-step [s]
nothing # hide
```

## Carburizing of alloy 16NiCrMo13

For alloy 16NiCrMo13 we perform 2 hours of carbon enrichment followed by 3 hours of zero flux (closed system) diffusion.

```@example carburizing
enrich  = 2hour
diffuse = 3hour
nothing # hide
```

Mass transfer coefficient is then declared as a time function. A *high* value of `1.0` enforces an *almost-Dirichlet* boundary condition, while `0.0` closes the system.

```@example carburizing
h = (t) -> (t < enrich) ? 1.0 : 0.0
nothing # hide
```

A wrapper was created to initialize the model and used below. Starting from initial time, we perform the carburizing step. The initial condition is provided through `x` with the alloy's initial carbon content.

```@example carburizing
model = getcarburizingmodel(L, N, h, T, yaeros)

t0 = 0.0
t = enrich
x = carburizemasstomolefraction(yaero0)
@time solve(model; t, τ, x, M, α, ε, t0)
res1 = plotsimulationresiduals(model.res[]; showinner = true)[1]
nothing # hide
```

Below we see the plot of convergence tracking during the solution. Through option `showinner = true` we see the internal steps residuals. The blue dots represent the end of step residual, all of which fall below the target convergence criterium.

```@example carburizing
res1 # hide
```

```@example carburizing
xticks = 0.0:0.2:1.2                                               # hide
yticks = 0.0:0.2:1.0                                               # hide
fig, ax = plotcarburizedprofile(model, yaero0; showstairs, xticks, # hide
                                yticks, label = "Carburizing")     # hide
nothing # hide
```

Now we continue the process from final time of carburizing for the whole diffusion interval. Again we inspect the residuals for this step to verify that everything worked as expected.

```@example carburizing
t0 = t
t = diffuse
x = nothing
@time solve(model; t, τ, x, M, α, ε, t0)
res2 = plotsimulationresiduals(model.res[]; showinner = true)[1]
nothing # hide
```

!!! note "About convergence"

    If a convergence plot is not really required, this check could be skipped. In fact the solver will issue warnings if any step did not reach internal convergence so no worries.

```@example carburizing
res2 # hide
```

Below we see the state of the system after both carburizing and homogeneization diffusion steps.

```@example carburizing
z = model.grid.r                                                     # hide
yc = carburizemoletomassfraction.(model.problem.x)                   # hide
lines!(ax, 1000z, 100reverse(yc); color = :red, label = "Diffusion") # hide
axislegend(ax; position = :rt)                                       # hide
fig                                                                  # hide
```

Mass intake approaches the reference value of 23.5 ``g\cdotp{}m^{-2}``obtained by diffusion profile integration by Dal'Maz Silva *et al.* [DalMazSilva2017](@cite).

## Carburizing of alloy 23MnCrMo5

For alloy 23MnCrMo5 we perform 2 hours of carbon enrichment followed by 4 hours of zero flux (closed system) diffusion. To make it shorter, all the code is presented in a single block below.

```@example carburizing
enrich  = 2hour
diffuse = 4hour

h = (t) -> (t < enrich) ? 1.0 : 0.0

model = getcarburizingmodel(L, N, h, T, yautos) 

t0 = 0.0
t = enrich
x = carburizemasstomolefraction(yauto0)
@time solve(model; t, τ, x, M, α, ε, t0)
xticks = 0.0:0.2:1.2                                               # hide
yticks = 0.2:0.2:1.0                                               # hide
fig, ax = plotcarburizedprofile(model, yauto0; showstairs, xticks, # hide
                                yticks, label = "Carburizing");    # hide

t0 = t
t = diffuse
x = nothing
@time solve(model; t, τ, x, M, α, ε, t0)

z = model.grid.r                                                     # hide
yc = carburizemoletomassfraction.(model.problem.x)                   # hide
lines!(ax, 1000z, 100reverse(yc); color = :red, label = "Diffusion") # hide
axislegend(ax; position = :rt)                                       # hide
fig                                                                  # hide
```

Mass intake does not approache the reference value of 15.3 ``g\cdotp{}m^{-2}``obtained by diffusion profile integration by Dal'Maz Silva *et al.* [DalMazSilva2017](@cite), but that obtained by direct sample mass change of 20.5 ``g\cdotp{}m^{-2}``. Because of the lack of experimental reproduction and high uncertainty in measurements, results are considered to be in good agreement.
